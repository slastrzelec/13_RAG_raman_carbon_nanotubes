M. Heise,a∗R. Kuckuk,a A. Srivastavab and B. P. Asthanab\nRecently, we have reported on the characterization of various carbonaceous materials including multiwalled carbon nanotube\n(MWCNT) ﬁlters, which have speciﬁc molecular ﬁltering capabilities and good mechanical strength and can be produced in\nbulk as highly aligned arrays of bundles of CNTs. We have extended our studies using Fourier transform-Raman spectroscopy\nwith 1064 nm excitation wavelength and a rotating sample holder in the region 1000–2800 cm−1, in addition to 532 and\n785 nm, which were used for Raman excitation in our previous study. Raman spectra were analyzed for band positions and\nline shape with special emphasis on the D-, G- and G′- bands. For the single-walled species, Carbotrap and graphite spectra\nwere also recorded with 488 nm excitation. A dispersion study has been made from the Raman data available with the different\nexcitation wavelengths. Slight band shifts and band broadening could be observed under the two sample conditions, one with\nthe stationary sample and the other with sample rotation. The spectral changes are related to the excessive heating caused in\na stationary sample by laser irradiation. Based on our ﬁndings in this study combined with our earlier study, we can state that\nonly a careful line shape analysis and study of intensity pattern of the D- and G-Raman bands under well-deﬁned measurement\nconditions lends itself as a good measure of degree of alignment in the MWCNT bundles.

There is much interest nowadays on\nthe different uses of these materials for general applications in\nanalytical science.[2] CNT-based transistors have been developed\nfor biosensing as well as other sensor applications.[3–5] The\nreview and the results presented by Hierold et al.[5] conﬁrmed\nthe potential and excellent performance of single-walled carbon\nnanotubes (SWCNTs) for sensors by the integration of the\ntubes in well-deﬁned micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)\nstructures. Recently Bokobza[6] performed mechanical, electrical\nand spectroscopic investigations of CNT-reinforced elastomers as\ncomposite materials, where matrices were ﬁlled with multiwalled\ncarbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). These applications may illustrate\nthe wide intrinsic potential of CNTs as novel materials.\nThe relationship of CNTs with other carbonaceous materials\nhas recently been discussed by Dresselhaus and Endo.[7] Many\ndifferent methods to grow CNTs have been reported in the\nliteratureandsomemostwidelyusedtechniquesarearcdischarge,\nlaser furnace and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Ando et al.[8]\npresented a review of these methods almost 5 years ago. Nearly\ncontemporary to this review, a special MWCNT variety forming\nmacroscopic hollow cylinders with radial alignment of its walls\nand having unique ﬁltering capabilities and high mechanical\nstrength was reported by Srivastava et al.[9] Recently, a scanning\nelectron microscope (SEM) and Raman spectroscopic study of\nMWCNT grown by a novel technique on ash-supported catalysts\nwas published.[10] Mono-dispersed SWCNTs made using an arc-\nburning method were described by Suzuki et al.[11]\nAlthoughtherearemanyreviewsandinvestigationsonSWCNTs,\nsee, for example, recent publications,[12–16] MWCNTs have less\nfrequently been the subject of different studies.

The calibration curves\nwith admixed nanostructured carbon were established for the\nRaman intensity ratios and the largest change was observed\nin the IG′/ID ratio. It was concluded that the calibration curves\nobtained from relative Raman intensity ratios may be used as a\nviable means for MWCNT purity assessment. A comparative study\nof SWCNT puriﬁcation technique using Raman spectroscopy has\nbeen communicated recently by Mususmeci et al.[19] In another\nrecent study,[20] the effect of intense laser on Raman modes of\nMWCNTshasbeenreportedbyvaryingtheintensityoftheincident\nlaser radiation for Raman excitation. It has been claimed that the\ndecrease in the disordered parameter (ID/IG) in laser-irradiated\nCNT shows a puriﬁcation of the CNTs.\nAlthough the present work was initially aimed only at\nextending our earlier study[17] using Fourier transform (FT)-Raman\nspectroscopy with a third excitation wavelength of 1064 nm,\nwhich led to spectral data only using a rotating sample holder,\nwe also recorded Raman spectra with 488 nm excitation. In view\nof the interesting studies from other groups as mentioned above,\nwe also performed our experiments under two experimental\nconditions as realized for 785 nm laser excitation wavelength, i.e.\none keeping the sample stationary and the other with sample\nrotation using a rotating sample holder, which has an effect on\nsample temperature. Thermal emission is known that it can have\na detrimental effect on the Raman spectra.[21,22]\nIn view of the foregoing discussion, when examining the\ndifferentintensityratiosunderthetwoconditions,namelywithand\nwithout rotation, concerns of intensity calibration of CCD-based\nRaman spectrometers were raised, for which further information\nis given in Ref. [23]. Finally, combining the results of earlier\nwork, where only two wavelengths, 532 and 785 nm, were used\nfor Raman excitation, we also could include a study on the\ndispersion of D- and G-bands for various carbonaceous materials.\nFurthermore, it was noticed that the intensities of D-, G- and\nG′-Raman bands in different carbonaceous materials including\nMWCNT ﬁlters show differences when the sample is stationary or\nrotating and it would be interesting to investigate whether the\ntemperature effect has a similar kind of inﬂuence on the Raman\nbands of MWCNTs as a variation in incident laser intensity as\nstudied recently.[20]\nExperimental\nMacro-scalehollowcarboncylindersuptocentimetresindiameter\nandseveralcentimetreslongconsistingofMWCNTswithdiameters\nranging from 20 to 50 nm were synthesized using a continuous\nspray pyrolysis method, where sprayed ferrocene-derived Fe\nparticles act as catalyst. The nanotubes grow in radial directions\non the walls of removable silica tube templates, leading to\nthe formation of freestanding and continuous hollow cylindrical\ncarbon tubes whose details are given elsewhere.[9]\nCNT materials for comparison were purchased from Aldrich\n(Milwaukee, WI, USA; see also Ref. [17]). One of the charges\nwas produced from CarboLex, Inc. of Lexington (Kentucky,\nUSA). The batch quantity (product # 519308) was of AP-grade\nwith bundles of SWCNTs (10–200 individual nanotubes per\nbundle with average diameters of 1.2–1.5 nm, bundle length\nof ∼20 µm; individual tube length of 2–5 µm). The purity of the\nAP-grade (as prepared) product ranged from 50% to 70% by\nvolume. Major impurities were carbon nanospheres and carbon-\nencapsulated catalyst nanoparticles. A second SWCNT material\n(product # 636797), speciﬁed as SWCNT (Aldrich), had diameters\nof 1–2 nm as measured by high-resolution transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HRTEM) with purity as follows: amorphous carbon:\n∼3%; other nanotubes: ∼40%; SWCNT >50% with an average\ndiameter of 1.1 nm and a length of 0.5–100 µm. The MWCNT (#\n636525), named here as MWCNT (Aldrich 1), was speciﬁed by the\nfollowing dimensions: OD × ID × length = 10–20 nm × 5–10 nm\n× 0.5–200 µm; carbon content ≥95%. We also procured a second\nMWCNT material from Aldrich with the following dimensions:\nOD × ID × length = 30–50 nm × 5–15 nm × 0.5–200 µm;\ncarbon content >95%–labeled as MWCNT (Aldrich 2), for which\nRaman spectra were recorded. As the spectra of the two batches\ndid not show any signiﬁcant differences, the data for one batch\nonly are presented and further discussed. Other materials studied\nwere pure graphite and Carbotrap20/40 mesh from Supelco\n(Bellefonte, PA, USA).\nThree dispersive spectrometers with different excitation wave-\nlengths were used. One of them was an XY-Dilor Raman spectrom-\neter (HORIBA Jobin Yvon GmbH) equipped with a confocal Raman\nmicroscope, a triple 0.5 m monochromator, a Nd : YAG laser from\nSpectra-Physics with frequency doubling (excitation wavelength\n532 nm) and a liquid-N2 cooled CCD from WRIGHT Instruments Ltd\nfor detection (slit width of 100 µm with integration time of 1000 s,\n25 spectral frame accumulations). The second spectrometer used\nin this study was a HoloSpec Raman spectrometer from Kaiser\nOptical Systems, Inc., equipped with a diode laser (λ = 785 nm)\nfrom SDL, Inc. and a liquid-N2 cooled CCD detector from RS Roper\nScientiﬁc (integration time, e.g. of 25 s with 10 spectral frame ac-\ncumulations, laser power of 14 mW). Further measurements were\ncarried out using a Raman spectrometer model Acton Tri-Vista\nfrom Princeton Instruments, equipped with a liquid-N2 cooled\nCCD detector from RS Roper Scientiﬁc, and a Spectra-Physics\nAr-Laser (wavelength of 488 nm).\nThe Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) Raman spectrome-\nter model PE-2000 (Perkin-Elmer, ¨Uberlingen, Germany) comprises\nof a 2 W diode pumped Nd : YAG laser (IE Optomech Ltd, Newn-\nham, UK) for NIR excitation (wavelength of 1064 nm) and a GaAs\ndetector. The following experimental conditions were chosen for\nspectral recordings: spectral resolution of 16 cm−1 and 1000 in-\nterferogram scans were coadded at 100 mW of laser power to get\nthe ﬁnal spectra. Spectra of reasonable signal-to-noise ratio could\nonly be obtained for graphite and SWCNT samples. For recording\nspectra of the other bulk materials, a rotating sample holder was\nused to reduce excessive sample heating from laser irradiation.\nThe spectra with 785 nm excitation were recorded for stationary\nsamples as well as with sample rotation. For sample rotation,\na mount was prepared out of a brass cylinder having 15-mm\ndiameter and 7-mm height. At open face of this brass piece, a\ncircular groove of 2-mm width (external and internal diameters 9\nand 7 mm, respectively) and 1-mm depth was cut. The samples\nof the carbonaceous materials were ﬁlled in this circular groove\nand pressed with a brass press having the same dimension in\norder to ensure uniform distribution of the sample over the entire\ngroove area. The sample holder could be rotated with 170–2500\nrevolutions per minute (rpm). The Raman scattered radiation from\nJ.

In the present study, in order to get better quality spectra\nwith 1064 nm excitation, it was rather necessary to use a rotating\nsampleholderforimprovingthequalityofthespectrasigniﬁcantly.\nIt was without difﬁculty to record also the low wavenumber region\nshowing the radial breathing mode band that is observable in the\nspectra of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs). For demonstrating\nthe inﬂuence of sample rotation, a typical study was made in\nthis work, where the spectra of two samples were recorded with\nvarying sample rotation speed in the range of 550–2500 rpm.\nThe spectra are presented in Fig. 4, and it is obvious that with\nincreasing rotation speed, the spectral quality goes on improving.\nFigure 2.

Detailed results were obtained by band deconvolution\nusing band ﬁtting. The detailed analysis of the prominent bands in\nthe Raman spectra for two different MWCNT varieties is presented\nin Fig. 6, where the D-, G- and G′-bands are analyzed for the\ncomponent bands. The results of the band ﬁtting procedures,\nusing OPUS software from Bruker Optics (Ettlingen, Germany) and\ngiving the peak position, linewidth (FWHM) and integrated band\nintensities, are presented in Table 1.

The latter band (also called D′) is typical\nfor defective graphite-like materials.[25,26] It has its origin from\na nonzero wavevector and is based on the double-resonance\nphenomenon, consequently facing a different physical origin\nfor both bands. The G-band complexity and nomenclature are\ndifferent for SWCNT with G+ and G−components.\nThe G- peak originates due to sp2 sites present in the sample,\nand this represents the ν(C\nC) stretching vibration of all pairs of\nsp2 atoms in both rings and chains. The composite peak nature\nand the shift are, in general, a consequence of nanotube curvature.\nThis curvature results into deviation from sp2 hybridization and\nconsequently the C–C bonds along the axis of the tube and\nalong the circumferential direction have different force constants,\nwhich in turn give rise to different vibrational wavenumbers for\nthe ν(C\nC) vibrations along the axis of the nanotube and in the\ncircumferential direction.\nThe band around ∼2610 cm−1 with 785 nm excitation in the\nspectra of MWCNTs is assigned to be G′-band.

For SWCNT, the G′-band appeared\naround ∼2600 cm−1, often with two band components. This band\nis known as the overtone band of the D-band. The wavenumber\nof the disorder-induced D-band and of its second-order overtone\nG′-bandintheRamanspectraofsp2 bondedcarbonmaterialshave\nbeen known for many years to exhibit a strong dispersive behavior\nas a function of the laser excitation energy.[17] The physical origin\nof the D- and G′-band features in the Raman spectra in isolated\nCNT as well as in MWCNTs is based on the double-resonance\nmechanism. The double-resonance effect in graphite occurs when\nboth initial and ﬁnal states, as well as the intermediate scattering\nstates are actually electronic states.\nDispersion of D- and G-bands\nIn our earlier study,[17] Raman D-band and degree of alignment\nwere the major points of emphasis. With only two wavelengths, i.e.\n532and785 nminthepreviousstudy,therewerenosufﬁcientdata\nfor determining the wavelength dependency of the dispersion\neffect by least squares. As the study has been extended taking\ninto account further excitation wavelengths, 488 and 1064 nm, we\nare able to discuss the dispersion in the different carbonaceous\nmaterials in more detail. The change in the peak position of the D-\nband with excitation wavelength has been explained in literature\nintermsofresonanceofelectronicandvibrationaldensityofstates.\nIthasbeenobservedincarbonaceousmaterialsthatwhenphonon\nwavenumbers vary with a change in excitation wavelength,[29–32]\na weak Raman signal is observed. In the present study, the spectra\nare recorded under two different sample conditions, one with\nstationary sample and the other with sample rotation. It can be\nseen from the spectra presented in Fig. 5 that there is a slight\ndifference in the band shapes and band shifts under two sample\nconditions (spectra had been measured one after another and\ndisplayed without CCD detector intensity correction). This aspect\nwill, however, be discussed in a forthcoming section, where the\nimplications of the intensity variation of the incident laser used for\nRaman excitation shall be discussed in more detail.\nThe dispersion of the Raman D-band is quite obvious if the\ndata presented in Table 1 is examined. The ﬁrst part of the table\ncontains data of analyzed Raman peaks with 532 nm excitation\nwithout rotation of the sample and 1064 nm excitation with\nsample rotation. The second part of the table contains the data of\nanalyzed Raman peaks with 785 nm excitation under both sample\nconditions. The Raman D-band shows a shift of ∼2 cm−1 between\nthe spectra recorded with sample rotation and without sample\nrotation using 785 nm excitation for the MWCNT ﬁlter (Table 1),\nwhereas the difference is more pronounced in the SWCNT samples\nstudies (4.2 and 5.9 cm−1, respectively). If we compare the Raman\npeaks corresponding to D-band for all the three excitations, e.g.\nfor MWCNT ﬁlter, the D-peaks are observed at 1352.3, 1314.2 and\n1290.8 cm−1 for 532, 785 and 1064 nm excitations, respectively.\nBand positions are summarized in Table 3, which also contains\nspectral data obtained with 488 nm excitation wavelength. The\ndata for all materials studied are graphically presented in Fig. 7(a),\nillustrating clearly a similar excitation wavelength dependency for\nall samples.\nThe wavenumbers of the D- and G′-bands, the different\nexcitation wavelengths and the corresponding energy values in\neV are presented in Table 3. The calculated G′-band positions are\ntwice the D-band wavenumbers, though experimental values\nhave been observed at lower values. This phenomenon has\nbeen explained for the Stokes Raman spectra in graphite by\nCanc¸ado et al.[33] using double-resonance mechanisms, whereas\nthe D-band overtone (G′-band) in anti-Stokes spectra has been\nshifted to larger wavenumbers than 2 ωD. From the spectral\ndata presented in this table, the dispersions of the D- and G′-\nbands were calculated for each material by a linear least squares\nﬁt taking the band positions versus the corresponding photon\nexcitation energy (in eV) into account as illustrated in Fig. 7.\nIn multiwalled nanotubes and graphite, the second-order peaks\naround 2695 cm−1 are attributed to a two-phonon process of the\nD-line at ∼1350 cm−1 (532 nm excitation wavelength) as reported\nin earlier studies.[34,35] Kastner et al.[35] reported dispersion values\nfor MWCNTs of 43 cm−1 eV−1 for the D-band and 89 cm−1 eV−1 for\nG′-band (excitation wavelengths between 457 and 676 nm).

We noticed also differences\nforgraphite(55.2±2.4 cm−1 eV−1 forD-band),whichislargerthan\nthose values reported earlier (for graphite ≈50 cm−1 eV−1[29]).\nThomsen[28] extended these measurements to SWCNTs and\nfound similar results and concluded on the basis of his mea-\nsurements that D and G′ (his nomenclature D∗) lines in SWNT\nshift with the excitation wavelength at the rate of 38 ± 2 and\n90 ± 3 cm−1 eV−1, respectively. Our values for SWCNT materials\nare found to be much larger (54 ± 2 and 112 ± 7 cm−1 eV−1) and\nare in better agreement with earlier studies by Pimenta et al. (re-\nspective values 53 and 106 cm−1 eV−1).[36] Thus, the dispersions\nof both D- and G′-bands in the case of aligned MWCNT bundles\n(ﬁlter variety) are similar to our SWCNT values, much higher in\ncomparison with those for SWCNT as reported by Thomsen,[28]\ncovering the range of 1.9 up to 2.8 eV for his excitation energy\ndependence study of the D- and G′-bands. When the large wave-\nlength range is considered, the excitation energy-dependency is\nnearly the same for all studied carbonaceous materials studied\nhere (see also Table 3).\nA comment is appropriate for the SWCNT materials, because\nthe mode characteristics provide information on the SWCNT\nelectronic properties (metallic or semiconducting), as well as\non their structural disorder.[25,37] Furthermore, the dispersive\ndisorder-induced D-mode is not only associated with the double-\nresonance effects but also dependent on the average tube\ndiameter.[38] The data show that G′- and D-band frequencies\nof both SWCNT varieties are lower than for the other carbon\nspecies, which is due to curvature effects on the D-band. This\nis further conﬁrmed by inspecting the Aldrich versus Carbolex\ndata. The SWCNT (Aldrich) sample has an average diameter\nmeasured by HRTEM larger than that of the Carbolex material;\nconsequently, the D and G′ frequencies follow the expected\ndiameter dependence as discussed in Ref. [38]. Using the linear\nrelationship as given for D-band data that was obtained for the\n785 nm laser excitation wavelength and an average diameter\nof 1.35 nm for the Carbolex SWCNT material, the predicted band\npositionis1295 cm−1 (experimentalvalue1292.4 cm−1).Using the\nsame function and the D-band wavenumber of the Aldrich SWCNT\nmaterial, a too large diameter of 3 nm is calculated. However,\nif our graphite D-band position of 1314.2 cm−1 – slightly higher\nthan the frequency of 1309 cm−1 as reported by Souza Filho\net al.[38] – is taken into account, a diameter value of 1.7 nm follows,\nwhich agrees with a plausible HRTEM average value that is in\ncontrasttothegivenaveragediameterreportedbythedistributor.\nThe suitability of the Raman spectrum for the determination of\nstructural parameters is demonstrated.\nDisorder and purity of the carbonaceous materials\nInourearlierstudy,[17] wereportedindetailonthecharacterization\nof various carbonaceous materials including a special variety of\nMWCNT bundles.[9] It was shown that ID/IG ratio of the Raman\nintensities for a given sample is strongly dependent on the laser\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jrs\nCopyright c⃝2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nJ.

For studying spectral\nintensities, especially recorded by different spectrometers, a\nrelative intensity correction using standard reference materials[23]\nbecomesessential.However,itisquitenaturaltoassumethatthere\nwill be some inﬂuence of the incident laser intensity on the general\nspectral features as pointed out by other authors.[21,22] Spectral\nbaselineeffectsweremuchreducedwithhighrotationspeedofthe\nsampleholder,allowingmoreaccuratebandintensityintegrations.\nBecause of the missing spectrometer intensity calibrations, the\ndependency of ID/IG on the laser excitation energies was not\nfurther elaborated, although the ratio has been suggested for\nquality assessment and production control.[17,40]\nPreviously,[17] two excitation wavelengths, i.e. 532 and 785 nm,\nwere used by us for recording the Raman spectra. In the present\nwork, however, when the study was extended taking 1064 nm\nas excitation wavelength and the attempts were made to record\nthe Raman spectra, it was observed that in certain cases, the\nspectra were of rather poor quality. A typical example of the\nRaman spectra recorded without sample rotation is presented in\nFig. 3(b). Recently DiLeo et al.[18] made a detailed study on purity\nassessment of MWCNTs by Raman spectroscopy. In their Raman\nstudy, calibration curves based on ID/IG, IG′/IG and IG′/ID ratios\nwere given, and it was concluded that these calibration curves\ncould be used for quantitative purity assessment. Earlier this group\nhad done a similar work on purity assessment of SWCNTs using\noptical absorption spectroscopy.[41]\nRecently,Ramanspectroscopyhasbeenexploitedtoinvestigate\neven the mechanical and electrical properties of CNT-based\nelastomers.[6] Inanotherrecentstudydefect-dependentannealing\nbehavior of MWCNTs was studied by Bhalerao et al.,[42] where ID/IG\nwas used as an important parameter to examine the effect of\nannealing. The annealing of MWCNTs was carried out in hydrogen\natmosphere at temperatures <1300 ◦C. Thus, it appears that ID/IG\nhas been used for studying many different properties of SWCNTs\nand MWCNTs.\nA more controversial study has been published recently by\nKumaret al.[20] whostudiedtheeffectofintenselaserandenergetic\nion irradiation on Raman modes of MWCNTs. Samples had been\nirradiated by a 514 nm Ar ion laser with a maximum laser power\nof 50 mW and with fractions of this, i.e. 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 12.5 and\n25 mW. The authors noticed quite some drastic changes in band\nposition for the D and G modes in the range up to 10 cm−1. In\naddition to this, the ID/IG ratio was monitored with the integral\nintensities obtained by Lorentz band ﬁtting. Although the G-mode\nband position behavior was fully reversible, the D-mode shifts did\nnot completely recover after sample exposure to maximum laser\npower when recorded again with lower laser power (spectral shift\ncompared with the band position recorded with a fresh sample\n4 cm−1).Theintensityratioalsoremainedconstantaftermaximum\nsample irradiation (ID/IG = 1.5±0.1), indicating some puriﬁcation\nor ordering in MWCNTs, possibly with a burn out of amorphous\ncarbon in air as suggested also by other authors. We studied\ntemperature effects with exposure to 15 mW laser power, but\napplying different sample rotation frequencies.\nWhen we started with a revolution frequency of 2500 rpm,\nband positions were highest for MWCNT (Aldrich 2) samples\n(1310.3 and 2615.7 cm−1 for D-band and G′-band positions,\nrespectively, whereas halving the revolution frequency moved\nthosewavenumbersto1308.7and2612.4 cm−1 (thebandposition\nof the G-band was shifted only marginally by 0.6 cm−1). Intensity\nratios ID/IG increased slightly from 3.8 to 3.9 for the higher\ntemperature sample at lower revolution frequency. Similar results\nfor the band shifts have been obtained for the SWCNT (CarboLex)\nsample: the D- and G′-band positions were shifted from 1289.3\nand 2571.7 cm−1 under 2500 rpm to 1287.5 and 2567.7 cm−1 with\n∼900 rpm, respectively. Here the G-band position changed more\nnoticeably from 1593.1 to 1589.8 cm−1. On the other hand, the\nintensity ratio ID/IG changed from 0.43 to 0.39 for the higher\ntemperature sample at lower revolution frequency, indicating\npossibly some very minor puriﬁcation if such interpretation is\npermitted.\nOn the basis of the results on ID/IG determined in our earlier\nstudy[17] as well as both ID/IG and IG′/IG in the present study,\nwe have arrived at the conclusion that it is probably an over-\nsimpliﬁcation and over-emphasis to make a quantitative purity\nassessment based on Raman intensity ratios, especially in the case\nof MWCNTs. In fact, by combining the results of our previous\nand the present study, we have been able to demonstrate that\nboth ID/IG and ID/IG′ ratios can tell more clearly about the degree\nof order and alignment in the MWCNT bundles. For the 785 nm\nRaman excitation, it seems that the intensity calibration for the\nsample rotation conditions had ampliﬁed the G′-band intensities\nby a factor of two.

Heise et al.\nstandard reference materials for checking the correct Raman\nintensities over a broad spectral range.\nFrom the results presented above and foregoing discussions,\nit is evident that under sample rotation condition, when a fresh\nlocation of the sample is always exposed to the incident laser\nradiation, the spectral quality is much better. Under a stationary\nsample condition, it is obvious also from the band broadening\nthat there is an excessive heating of the sample due to resonant\nabsorption of the incident laser radiation. On the basis of the\nresults obtained in this study, we have arrived at the conclusion\nthat sample rotation for bulk samples, even if not an absolute\nnecessity, is deﬁnitely a better option for recording the Raman\nspectra of SWCNTs and MWCNTs in order to get a better spectral\nquality.\nConclusions\nA dispersion study of both D- and G′(D∗)-bands of the MWCNT\n(ﬁlter) was made using the data obtained from the Raman\nmeasurements taking three different excitation wavelengths,\nnamely 532, 785 and 1064 nm, into account. The dispersion of D-\nand G′-bands evaluated from the wavenumber positions obtained\nthrough line shape analysis of the experimental proﬁles turned\nout to be 52.7 ± 1.3 and 109.9 ± 4.0 cm−1 eV−1 (energy of the\nincident photon), respectively, which are signiﬁcantly different\nand higher as compared with what was reported for SWCNT\nand other carbonaceous materials based on smaller changes in\nRaman excitation wavelengths. For other materials, also spectral\ndata obtained with 488 nm excitation wavelength was available.\nA signiﬁcant result of this study was an obvious enhancement in\nthe overall spectral quality with regard to baseline and intensity of\nall the three major features, namely D-, G- and G′-bands, when the\nsample was rotated as compared with the observed intensity with\na stationary sample. In conclusion, our ﬁndings from this study\ntogether with our earlier study demonstrate that a careful line\nshape analysis along with the intensity pattern of the D- and G-\nRaman bands measured under well-deﬁned conditions may lend\nitself as a tool to measure the degree of alignment in the MWCNT\nbundles.\nAcknowledgements\nB.
