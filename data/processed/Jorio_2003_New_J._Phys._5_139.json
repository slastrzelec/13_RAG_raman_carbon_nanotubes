Introduction\nThis review is aimed at researchers and engineers who are not experts in Raman spectroscopy,\nbut want to use this technique as an easy and quick characterization tool for carbon nanotube\nsamples. The Raman spectra from carbon nanotubes are rich in information about the structure\nand properties of nanotubes and the present review should provide a guide for people wanting to\nunderstand questions such as: What is the radial breathing mode (RBM) feature in the Raman\nspectra telling me about my sample? What information is provided by the tangential modes?\nShould I worry about the laser frequency I am using? Can I use the disorder-induced D band\nto characterize defects in my sample? Is light polarization important? What can I learn using\nsurface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and another optical techniques?\nThis paper is divided into sections, the ﬁrst discussing some important experimental details,\nand the following sections answering each of the questions outlined in the previous paragraph.\n2. Some important experimental details\nIn this paper we discuss the Raman spectra from both isolated and bundled carbon nanotubes.\nDifferent carbon nanotube bundled samples were synthesized by different methods, including\nthe chemical vapour deposition (CVD), HiPCo and electric arc methods [1]. Isolated single\nwall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were grown on a Si/SiO2 substrate containing catalytic iron\nnano-particles [2], using a CVD method (diameters ranging from about 1 to 3 nm, according\nto atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization) [3]. The density of SWNTs µm−2 can be\ncontrolled during the growth process, basically by controlling the time of growth. Sonication of\nSWNT bundle samples in solution can also form isolated SWNTs, but the sonication method is\nless appropriate for single nanotube spectroscopy studies, since introduction of nanotube defects\nand nanotube fracturing occurs through the sonication process itself, and small bundles often\npersist after sonication. Nanotubes enclosed by SDS surfactant guarantee that tubes separated\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 139.1–139.17 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

However, the presence of the SDS micelles should modify the\nbasic properties of the nanotubes to some extent.\nResonance Raman spectra from SWNTs were acquired using standard commercial micro-\nRaman spectrometers and lasers, including systems connected with central user facilities, such as\na Renishaw (1000B) spectrometer and a Kaiser (Hololab 5000R) single-monochromator micro-\nRaman spectrometer, and also a Dilor XY triple-monochromator micro-Raman spectrometer,\nusing a back-scattering conﬁguration for all measurements and 50×, 80× and 100× objective\nlenses (∼1 µm spot size for the 100× objective).\nRelatively high laser powers (up to\n40 × 109 W m−2) can be used to probe isolated SWNTs because of their unusually high\nthermal conductivity values (3000 W m−1 K−1) [5], their excellent high temperature stability\nand their good thermal contact to the substrate. A triple-monochromator is ideal for the Raman\nmeasurements while tuning the excitation laser line continuously, but the acquired intensity\ndrops substantially when compared to the intensity obtainable from a single-monochromator\nspectrometer. We have measured the Raman spectra from SWNTs using discrete lines from\nAr–Kr and He–Ne lasers and also using a continuous range of excitation energies from both a\nTi:sapphire and a dye laser. We have observed stable nanotube Raman signals for laser powers\nimpinging on the substrate up to 40 mW into a 100× objective. We usually use laser powers of\nabout 10 mW in our measurements, although measurements have been carried out successfully\nwith laser power levels down to 1 mW (∼1 × 109 W m−2).\nIn the process of measuring the Raman spectra from isolated SWNTs on a Si/SiO2 substrate\nusing a ﬁxed laser energy Elaser, we focus the laser spot on the substrate surface and we scan\nthe sample until we observe the Raman signal from an isolated SWNT. The Raman intensity\nfrom SWNTs is usually buried under the noise, except for a few (n, m) SWNTs for which the\nresonance with the given Elaser occurs strongly for the electronic states conﬁned within the van\nHove singularities (vHSs). The observation of the weak Si feature at 303 cm−1 is a useful guide\nfor knowing whether the radial breathing Raman mode from an isolated SWNT can be measured.\nFigure 1(a) shows an example of Raman signals from two resonant SWNTs in two different spots\non the Si/SiO2 surface. The peaks at 156 and 192 cm−1 are the RBMs from the resonant SWNTs,\nwhile the step at 225 cm−1 and the peak at 303 cm−1 come from the Si substrate. For various\nexperiments of interest, we have used samples with a variety of nanotube densities, ranging\nfrom low density samples (∼0.4 SWNT µm−2) to higher density samples (∼10 SWNT µm−2).\nSamples with a high nanotube density (more than 1 SWNT µm−2) guarantee that the search for\nresonant nanotubes will not be so tedious, but a low density sample (less than 1 SWNT µm−2)\nguarantees that one will not get a Raman signal from two or more SWNTs within the same\nlight spot. A spectrum containing a signal from more than one SWNT restricts the wealth of\ninformation that is provided at the single nanotube level.\nFigure 1(b) gives a general view of the Raman spectra from a sample of SWNT bundles.\nThe lower trace shows the two dominant Raman features, the RBM and the tangential (G band)\nfeatures. In the upper trace, the background intensity is increased to show the rich Raman spectra\nover the entire ﬁrst- and second-order phonon frequency range between the RBM and G features,\nincluding the disorder-induced D band and other lower intensity features. The power used to\nmeasure the Raman spectra for SWNT bundles without burning the sample should be much\nlower than for isolated SWNTs, usually not higher than 1 mW using a 100× objective lens.\nThe Raman features are analysed by a Lorentzian ﬁt of the spectra, with the exception of\nthe lower frequency G-band feature, denoted by G−, which, for metallic SWNTs is observed\nto have a Breit–Wigner–Fano (BWF) lineshape (broad and asymmetric peak), though the G−\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 139.1–139.17 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

The background is enlarged to show the\nrichness of the Raman spectra from SWNTs over this large frequency range.\nfeature for semiconducting SWNTs remains Lorentzian. Although it is known that the disorder-\ninduced D band appears in the Raman spectra of graphite-like materials through a double\nresonance process [6, 7], where inhomogeneous broadening occurs, we use the Lorentzian ﬁt as\nan approximation to interpret the behaviour of the D band.\n3. Importance of the electronic structure and excitation laser energy\nUsually Raman spectra only involve phonons explicitly, being independent of the electronic\nstructure of the material and the laser energy used to excite the Raman spectra. Furthermore, the\nusual Raman scattering signal is weak. However, the scattering efﬁciency gets larger when the\nlaser energy matches the energy between optically allowed electronic transitions in the material,\nand this intensity enhancement process is called resonance Raman scattering [8]. The resonance\nRaman intensity depends on the density of electronic states (DOS) available for the optical\ntransitions, and this property is very important for one-dimensional (1D) systems, as we discuss\nin what follows.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 139.1–139.17 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

Distortion from this simple one-electron model is expected for the\nlower energy transitions ES\n11 and for SWNTs with dt < 1 nm.\nFigures 2(a)–(c) shows the DOS for three different SWNTs, and since SWNTs are 1D\nsystems, their DOS is characterized by the so-called van Hove singularities (vHSs). The sharp\nvHSs deﬁne narrow energy ranges where the DOS intensity becomes very large. Therefore,\nin practice, a single carbon nanotube exhibits a ‘molecular-like’ behaviour, with well deﬁned\nelectronic energy levels at each vHS. The three DOS curves in ﬁgures 2(a)–(c) come from\ndifferent SWNTs as labelled by their (n, m) indices [9] (see caption). Each pair of indices\ndeﬁnes a unique way to roll up the graphene sheet to form the nanotube, and each unique\n(n, m) nanotube has a distinct electron and phonon structure. An observable Raman signal\nfrom a carbon nanotube can be obtained when the laser excitation energy is equal to the energy\nseparation between vHSs in the valence and conduction bands (e.g., see ES\n11, ES\n22 and EM\n11 in\nﬁgure 2), but restricted to the selection rules for optically allowed electronic transitions [10]–\n[12]. Because of this resonance process, Raman spectra at the single nanotube level allow us\nto study the electronic and phonon structure of SWNTs in great detail. When Raman spectra\nof SWNT bundle samples are taken, only those SWNTs with Eii in resonance with the laser\nexcitation energy Elaser will contribute strongly to the spectrum.\nFor the characterization of nanotubes by Raman spectroscopy, it is useful to consider plots\nof the energies Eii versus the nanotube diameter, dt, as shown in ﬁgure 2(d) [15]. Each point in\nthis plot represents one optically allowed electronic transition energy (Eii) from a given (n, m)\nSWNT. Crosses come from semiconducting SWNTs, and circles from metallic SWNTs. This\nplot should be considered as a guide for answering the question ‘if I use a given Elaser to excite\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 139.1–139.17 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

Radial breathing modes—RBM\nThe RBM Raman features (appearing between 120 cm−1 < ωRBM < 250 cm−1 for SWNTs\nwithin 1 nm < dt < 2 nm) correspond to the atomic vibration of the C atoms in the radial\ndirection, as if the tube was breathing (see ﬁgure 3).\nThese features are very useful for\ncharacterizing nanotube diameters through the relation ωRBM = A/dt + B, where the A and\nB parameters are determined experimentally. For typical SWNT bundles in the diameter range\ndt = 1.5±0.2 nm, A = 234 cm−1 nm and B = 10 cm−1 has been found for SWNT bundles [16]\n(where B is an upshift coming from tube–tube interaction). For isolated SWNTs on an oxidized\nSi substrate, A = 248 cm−1 nm and B = 0 have been found [3, 17]. It is important to point out\nthat, for the usual diameter range 1 nm < dt < 2 nm, these two sets of parameters give similar\ndt for a given ωRBM, differing considerably only for dt < 1 nm and dt > 2 nm (see ﬁgure 4).\nHowever, for dt < 1 nm, the simple ωRBM = A/dt + B relation is not expected to hold due to\nnanotube lattice distortions leading to a chirality dependence of ωRBM [18]. For large diameter\ntubes (dt > 2 nm) the intensity of the RBM feature is weak and is hardly observable.\nAs discussed in the previous section, it is useful to have the (Eii versus dt) plot (ﬁgure 2(d))\non hand when acquiring the RBM spectra from a SWNT sample. Figure 5 shows a connection\nbetween the (Eii versus 1/dt) plot (bottom) and the (IRBM versus ωRBM) Raman spectra (top)\nusing the relation ωRBM = 248/dt.

The hypothetical Raman spectra that would be observed\nfrom this sample would depend on the energy of the excitation laser light, and using Elaser =\n1.58 eV (785 nm from the Ti:sapphire laser) for example, the Raman spectra would look like\nthe curve shown in ﬁgure 5(a).

Ephonon is the phonon energy and \u0002r is the\nbroadening factor related to the lifetime for the excited state (\u0002r = 8 meV [20]). For the Raman\nspectra of a real sample taken with a given Elaser, the resonance proﬁle will be compounded by\nthe Gaussian distribution of the sample.\nIt is clear that a single Raman measurement gives an idea of the tubes that are in resonance\nwith that laser line, but does not give a complete characterization of the diameter distribution of\nthe sample. However, by taking Raman spectra using many laser lines, a good characterization\nof the diameter distribution in the sample can be obtained [16].\nThe natural linewidths for the RBM feature observed for isolated SWNTs are γRBM =\n3 cm−1, although larger \u0002RBM values are usually observed due to broadening effects [19].\nThe broadening has been observed to increase as the SWNT diameter is increased, and\n\u0002RBM > 20 cm−1 values have been observed for dt > 2 nm [19]. For the features observed\nin SWNT bundles, the linewidth will not reﬂect \u0002RBM, but it will rather reﬂect the ensemble of\ntubes in resonance with Elaser.\nIn summary, a careful analysis of ﬁgure 2(d), considering the Elaser line to be used, should\nbe made to correctly understand the RBM information that can be obtained from the Raman\nspectra from an actual SWNT sample.\nIt is also important to point out that, at the single isolated SWNT level, accurate\ndeterminationofthe Eii fortheresonantSWNTcanbedonebyusingatunablelaser(Eii deﬁnition\nwith ±3 cm−1 accuracy—see [20]), or simply by measuring the Stokes and anti-Stokes signals,\nEii can be obtained with a single laser line (Eii deﬁnition with ±10 cm−1 accuracy—see [21]).\n5.

Unlike graphite, the tangential G mode in SWNTs gives\nrise to a multi-peak feature, also named the G band, where up to six Raman peaks can be observed\nin a ﬁrst-order Raman process. However, a simple analysis can be carried out considering the\ntwo most intense peaks, that basically originate from the symmetry breaking of the tangential\nvibration when the graphene sheet is rolled to make a cylindrically shaped tube (see ﬁgure 3).\nThe two most intense G peaks are labelled G+, for atomic displacements along the tube axis,\nand G−, for modes with atomic displacement along the circumferential direction (see ﬁgures 3\nand 6), and the lowering of the frequency for the G−mode is caused by the curvature of the\nnanotube which softens the tangential vibration in the circumferential direction.\nThe difference between the G band lineshape for semiconducting and metallic SWNTs is\nevident in the lineshape of the G−feature (see ﬁgure 6), which is broadened for metallic SWNTs\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 139.1–139.17 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

This\nbroadened G−feature is usually ﬁt using a BWF line that accounts for the coupling of a discrete\nphonon with a continuum related to conduction electrons [23, 24]. This BWF line is observed\nin many graphite-like materials with metallic character, such as n-doped graphite intercalation\ncompounds (GIC) [25], n-doped fullerenes, as well as metallic SWNTs.\nConsidering the (Eii versus dt) plot in ﬁgure 2(d), for a given Elaser line, one can predict\nthe diameter range where semiconducting-like G−band lineshapes will be observed and the\ndiameter range for which the metallic-like G−band should be observed [22]. Observation of a\nmetallic-like G band when a semiconducting lineshape should be observed indicates the presence\nof charged impurities [26].\nFigure 7 shows the diameter dependence of the G+ frequency (ωG+) and the G−frequency\n(ωG−) for metallic and semiconducting SWNTs (see also ﬁgure 9). While ωG+ is practically\nindependent of tube diameter, ωG−decreases when decreasing dt, and this decrease becomes\nlarger as the curvature of the sheet increases [27, 28]. Therefore, the splitting \u0004ωG = ωG+ −ωG−\ncan be used for diameter characterization (see table 1).

For metallic SWNTs, the broadening\nis minor for \u0002G+, while for \u0002G−a signiﬁcant broadening occurs, and it is found that the linewidth\nfor the BWF line is strongly dependent on tube diameter. For isolated tubes with dt > 2 nm,\n\u0002G−is similar to semiconducting SWNTs, and the line mostly looks like a normal Lorentzian,\nreﬂecting the small magnitude of the BWF effect. The BWF effect increases as the tube diameter\ndecreases, causing the G−feature to become more asymmetric and broad (see ﬁgure 9). Values\nof \u0002G−> 70 cm−1 have been observed for isolated metallic SWNTs [19].\nIt is important to comment here that there are recent works reporting evidence for the G\nband Raman signal originating from a double resonance mechanism [30, 31]. In such a case, the\nG band intensity depends on defects and its frequency is Elaser dependent, making it complicated\nto use their Raman spectra for SWNT characterization. However, it can be shown that the double\nresonance and single resonance mechanisms exhibit the same intensity in a defective material,\nwhile the single resonance process is two orders of magnitude higher in intensity than the double\nresonance process for a good quality aligned sample [32], and the Raman spectra can be used\nfor SWNT characterization of good quality samples.\n6.

By using the spectra obtained with\n1.58 eV, a −18.9 value for β was obtained for the D band [42].\nc The coefﬁcient n = 2 was found by analysing the G band with only two Lorentzian\npeaks [27]. A different value is found when using six Raman allowed peaks to ﬁt the\nG-band spectra [28].\nd The coefﬁcient β for the G−component is, respectively, −45.7 and −79.5 cm−1 nm2\nfor semiconducting and metallic SWNTs, and 1.58, 2.41 and 2.54 eV laser lines were\nused to obtain the G-band experimental results used in the ﬁtting procedure [27].\ne Reference [43].\nAlthough strict polarization studies require selection rules and phonon/electron symmetry\nanalysis [28, 33, 34], there is a general and simple polarization behaviour that one should have\nin mind when acquiring the Raman spectra from a sample of aligned carbon nanotubes. Carbon\nnanotubes behave as antennas, with the absorption/emission of light being highly suppressed for\nlight polarized perpendicular to the nanotube axis [35, 36]. Therefore, if one wants to measure\nRaman spectra from a sample of aligned carbon nanotubes, the largest Raman intensity will be\ngenerally observed for light polarized along the tube axes, and almost no signal will be observed\nfor cross polarized light (see ﬁgure 8) [37]–[40]. This ‘antenna effect’ is found to become less\nefﬁcient as the tube diameter increases, but the polarization effect is highly effective in the range\n0.4 nm < dt < 2 nm.\nIn single nanotube spectroscopy, where the sample is not optically visible, it is helpful\nto optimize the signal by using a λ/2 wave plate to rotate the polarization of the incident and\nscattered light [37]. Attention to the polarization of the light is important for carrying out\nquantitative studies of the Raman intensity.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 139.1–139.17 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",
    "139.13\n7. Disorder-induced D band\nThe ﬁrst question one has about the D band in the carbon nanotube spectra is: ‘Can I use it\nfor defect characterization?’ Up to now, there is no deﬁnitive answer to this question since no\nsystematic study has yet been carried out to correlate the presence of the D band with different\ndefect types (such as hetero-atoms, vacancies, heptagon–pentagon pairs, kinks, or even the\npresence of impurities, etc). However, relevant information has been obtained, as discussed in\nwhat follows.\nFrom a large number of Raman spectra from isolated SWNTs (over 100 signals from\nphysically different tubes), about 50% exhibit observable D band signals with weak intensity\n(usually 100 times smaller than the G band—see ﬁgure 9). In isolated carbon nanotubes, a large\nD peak compared with the G peak usually means a bad resonance condition (i.e., Elaser is not\nclose to Eii). In these cases, the observation of a peak around 1450 cm−1 is also common (see\nﬁgure 9). Note that in ﬁgure 1(b) the D band is very weak, with an intensity similar to the\nmany other SWNT features observed in the frequency range between the RBM and the G band,\ndiscussed in the following section. The observation of large D-band peaks compared with the G\npeak intensity in SWNT bundles usually indicates the presence of amorphous carbon [41].\nThere are two characteristics that differentiate the D band in carbon nanotubes from the D\nband in defective graphite.\n(1) Small linewidths. From the observation of a large number of D band features from isolated\nSWNTs, \u0002D values from 40 cm−1 down to 7 cm−1 have been observed [19]. It is usual\nto observe the Raman spectra from SWNT samples to be composed of a broad peak upon\nwhich is superimposed a sharper peak, the broad feature coming from amorphous carbon\nand the sharper feature coming from the carbon nanotubes.\n(2) Lower frequencies. The D-band frequency ωD in carbon nanotubes is usually lower than ωD\nfrom bulk sp2-based carbons, and the downshift increases with decreasing tube diameter,\nwith ωD showing a 1/dt dependence [42]. This frequency dependence on tube diameter is\nactually not a unique D-band characteristic, but it is observed for other Raman features, as\nsummarized in table 1.\nFinally, the D band also exhibits a very important property that is a frequency dependence\non chiral angle. This topic will be discussed in the next section together with other chirality-\ndependent features.\n8. Other Raman features\nThe rich spectral features between the RBM and G modes (see ﬁgure 1(b)) originate from either\na double-resonance process [6, 7] or from folding the phonon dispersion of 2D graphite into a\n1D Brillouin zone. Most of the peaks are so weak that they must be viewed on an expanded\nscale to appear clearly in the spectra, and the physics needed to understand their behaviour is\nalso more sophisticated.\nThesepeaks areinteresting fornanotubecharacterization,ﬁrst becausethey giveinformation\nabout many phonon branches, important for transport, thermal and mechanical properties of\ncarbon nanotubes, and second because they exhibit chirality-dependent frequencies.\nThis\nchirality dependence of the peak frequencies for the weak spectral features can be understood,\nconsidering that they come from the interior of the anisotropic 2D phonon Brillouin zone.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 139.1–139.17 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",
    "139.14\nDifferent (n, m) nanotubes mean different folding of the 2D phonon dispersion. For a ﬁxed\nphonon wavevector magnitude |q| from a high symmetry point (e.g., the K point), the phonon\nfrequencies are different for different phonon propagation directions. During the folding process,\nthis property results in having the phonon frequencies for nanotubes with ﬁxed diameters, depend\non chiral angle. For example, the D band was shown to exhibit a \u0004ωD = 24 cm−1 frequency\ndifference between armchair and zigzag carbon nanotubes [44].\nHowever, this analysis is useful mostly forisolated SWNTs. ForSWNT bundles, theD-band\nspectrum usually shows an overlap of many peaks from different (n, m) tubes in resonance with\nElaser. Analysis of the detailed lineshape of the D-band can be performed based on resonance\nRaman theory [45]. Similar chirality-dependent effects are observed for the other weak features\nin the Raman spectra occurring in the spectral region between the RBM and G-band features.\n9. Complementary optical techniques\nSERS can be considered as a complementary technique to probe carbon nanotubes. SERS\nhas been developed to probe the Raman spectra from single molecules, whose weak Raman\nsignal would not otherwise be observable. In the case of carbon nanotubes, this technique can\nbe important for observing the Raman spectra from carbon nanotubes that do not satisfy the\nresonance condition for a given Elaser. Although many studies have been carried out to show\nthe enhancement of the Raman signal from carbon nanotubes when using SERS [46]–[49], a\nsystematic study of the difference between SERS enhanced versus resonantly enhanced carbon\nnanotube signals is still to be performed.\nInfrared (IR)spectroscopy, optical absorption and luminescencehavealso been used tostudy\ncarbon nanotubes. IR has been applied to SWNT bundles [50, 51], optical absorption has been\nused to study both isolated SWNTs [4] and carbon nanotube bundles [15], while luminescence\nhas been observed from isolated semiconducting SWNTs [4].\nFor phonon studies, Raman spectroscopy has been by far the most informative and sensitive\ntechnique. The IR signal from carbon nanotubes is very weak [50, 51], and it does not exhibit the\nrich resonance effect that couples electrons to photons. However, IR has been used to study the\nplasma frequency in carbon nanotubes and the presence of mini-gaps (meV) in ‘quasi-metallic’\nSWNTs [51]. Furthermore, a quantitative procedure for the evaluation of the carbonaceous purity\nof bulk quantities of as-prepared SWNT soot can be obtained by the utilization of solution-phase\nnear-IR spectroscopy [52].\nFor electronic studies, optical absorption and luminescence have strong advantages over\nRaman spectroscopy:\n(i) the signals are usually much stronger;\n(ii) scanning over excitation laser energies is usually easier;\n(iii) these techniques usually probe lower energy bands, such as ES\n11, which are not as accessible\nwith standard available Raman equipment.\nThese techniques can also be used for Eii measurements, although for a complete structural\n(n, m) assignment, they require additional information that can be obtained only from using joint\ntechniques, such as Raman measurements of the RBMs, for example [4, 53]. Furthermore, the\nluminescence signal can only be observed for isolated semiconducting SWNTs. Bundled tubes\nusually exhibit non-radiative electron–phonon recombination processes that greatly restrict the\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 139.1–139.17 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",
    "139.15\nexcited state photon lifetime and strongly compete with the luminescence process [4, 53]. Also\nmetallic tubes have no energy bandgap, and therefore there is no corresponding light emission.\n10. Multi-wall carbon nanotubes—MWNTs\nFor Raman scattering, multi-wall carbon nanotubes can be said to be an ensemble of carbon\nnanotubes with diameters ranging from small to very large. Because of the large diameter of the\nouter tubes for typical MWNTs, most of the characteristic differences that distinguish between\nthe Raman spectra in carbon nanotubes from that for graphite are not so evident in MWNTs. The\nRaman features associated with the small diameter inner tubes can sometimes be observed when\na good resonance condition is established [54, 55], but it is not the usual result. The RBM from\nlargediametertubes is usually too weak to beobservable. Figure6 shows theG band foraMWNT\nbundle sample. The shoulder at higher frequency (∼1618 cm−1) is typical of defective graphite-\nlike materials and can be smaller in better quality MWNT samples. Whereas the G+ −G−\nsplitting is large for small diameter tubes (see section 5), this double-peak G band splitting for\nlarge diameter MWNTs is both small and smeared out because of the diameter distribution and\ntherefore the G feature predominantly exhibits a weakly asymmetric characteristic lineshape,\nwith a peak appearing at the graphite frequency 1580 cm−1. These properties makes it more\ndifﬁcult to differentiate the Raman signal of MWNTs from that of graphite.\n11. Final remarks\nIt is important to stress once more that when studying the Raman signal from SWNTs, the\nKataura plot of Eii versus dt, showing the (n, m) SWNTs for which Elaser = Eii, should be used\nas a guide for understanding the Raman spectra from SWNTs, both in bundles and as isolated\ntubes. A simple tight binding model considering only nearest-neighbour coupling (γ0 = 2.9 eV\nand s = 0) is satisfactory for interpreting most of the features of the general Raman spectra. For\nsmall diameter tubes (below 1 nm) and for lower energy transitions ES\n11 a more complete model\nmust be considered [4, 17].\nThe use of Raman spectroscopy for characterizing SWNT bundles is easy, and is one of\nthe best characterization tools. Even on ‘dirty’ samples (full of amorphous carbon, catalyst\nor any other impurities), it is common that high laser powers burn impurities ﬁrst, leaving\ncleaner SWNT samples behind [56, 57]. This process can be followed by an improvement in\nthe characteristic Raman signal of the sample when the incident laser power is slowly increased.\nRaman spectroscopy becomes even more powerful for isolated SWNTs, giving detailed and\naccurate structural and electronic characterization. The Raman experiment is simple, can be\ndone at room temperature and ambient pressure, and is quick, non-destructive and non-invasive.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge Professor A Righi for providing the MWNT spectrum and\nDr A C Ferrari for valuable discussions.\nThis work was supported by the Instituto de\nNanociˆencias, Brazil.
