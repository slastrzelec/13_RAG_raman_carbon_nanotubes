    "Interpretation of Raman spectra of disordered and amorphous carbon\nA. C. Ferrari* and J. Robertson\nDepartment of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, United Kingdom\n~Received 24 November 1999!\nThe model and theoretical understanding of the Raman spectra in disordered and amorphous carbon are\ngiven. The nature of the G and D vibration modes in graphite is analyzed in terms of the resonant excitation of\np states and the long-range polarizability of p bonding. Visible Raman data on disordered, amorphous, and\ndiamondlike carbon are classiﬁed in a three-stage model to show the factors that control the position, intensity,\nand widths of the G and D peaks. It is shown that the visible Raman spectra depend formally on the conﬁgu-\nration of the sp2 sites in sp2-bonded clusters. In cases where the sp2 clustering is controlled by the sp3\nfraction, such as in as-deposited tetrahedral amorphous carbon ~ta-C! or hydrogenated amorphous carbon\n~a-C:H! ﬁlms, the visible Raman parameters can be used to derive the sp3 fraction.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe great versatility of carbon materials arises from the\nstrong dependence of their physical properties on the ratio of\nsp2 ~graphitelike! to sp3 ~diamondlike! bonds.1 There are\nmany forms of sp2-bonded carbons with various degrees of\ngraphitic ordering, ranging from microcrystalline graphite to\nglassy carbon. In general, an amorphous carbon can have any\nmixture of sp3, sp2, and even sp1 sites, with the possible\npresence of up to 60 at. % hydrogen. The compositions are\nconveniently shown on the ternary phase diagram, Fig. 1.\nWe deﬁne diamondlike carbon ~DLC! as amorphous carbon\nwith a signiﬁcant fraction of sp3 bonds. The hydrogenated\namorphous carbons ~a-C:H! have a rather small C-C sp3\ncontent. DLC’s with higher sp3 content are termed tetrahe-\ndral amorphous carbon ~ta-C! and its hydrogenated analog\nta-C:H. Another crucial parameter is the degree of clustering\nof the sp2 phase, which should be added as a fourth dimen-\nsion in the ternary phase diagram.1 Amorphous carbons with\nthe same sp3 and H content show different optical, elec-\ntronic, and mechanical properties according to the clustering\nof the sp2 phase.\nRaman spectroscopy is a standard nondestructive tool for\nthe characterization of crystalline, nanocrystalline, and amor-\nphous carbons.2–14 The Raman spectrum of diamond consists\nof the T2g 1332-cm21 zone center mode.2 The Raman spec-\ntra of disordered graphite show two quite sharp modes, the G\npeak around 1580–1600 cm21 and the D peak around 1350\ncm21, usually assigned to zone center phonons of E2g sym-\nmetry\nand\nK-point\nphonons\nof\nA1g\nsymmetry,\nrespectively.3–6 The unusual fact is that G and D peaks, of\nvarying intensity, position, and width, continue to dominate\nthe Raman spectra of nanocrystalline and amorphous car-\nbons, even those without widespread graphitic ordering.\nThe key property of interest in DLC is the sp3 content.1\nThis is usually measured by nuclear magnetic resonance\n~NMR! or electron-energy-loss spectroscopy ~EELS!, but\nthese are time-consuming and destructive methods. Raman\nscattering is sometimes used to probe the sp2/sp3 fraction in\nDLC’s. However, visible Raman spectroscopy is 50–230\ntimes7,8 more sensitive to sp2 sites, as visible photons pref-\nerentially excite their p states. uv Raman spectroscopy, with\nits higher photon energy of 5.1 eV, excites both the p and\nthe s states and so is able to probe both the sp2 and sp3\nsites, allowing a direct probe of the sp3 bonding.15,16 Never-\ntheless, visible Raman spectroscopy is widely used on\nDLC’s, and it would be very useful to have a framework in\nwhich at least indirectly derive the sp3 fraction of DLC’s.\nThe aim of this paper is to describe in detail the Raman\nprocess in disordered carbons. It is shown that the visible\nRaman spectrum depends fundamentally on the ordering of\nsp2 sites and only indirectly on the fraction of sp3 sites. We\ngive a restricted range of conditions under which it is pos-\nsible to use visible Raman spectroscopy to derive the sp3\ncontent. To do this, we ﬁrst describe the atomic and elec-\ntronic structure of amorphous carbon and then the nature of\nRaman scattering in disordered carbons, both of which show\nunique features. We then present a three-stage model relating\nthe visible Raman parameters to the sp2 nanostructure and\ncontent of disordered carbons. This is sufﬁciently general to\nhold for all amorphous carbons, both hydrogenated and\nhydrogen-free. This paper focuses on the G and D peaks,\nneglecting other features that are sometimes present, such as\nFIG. 1. Ternary phase diagram of amorphous carbons.

The sp3 sites\nhave only s states while the sp2 sites also possess p states.\nIt is often possible to treat s and p states separately. s and p\nbonds have a signiﬁcantly different behavior. s bonds are\ntwo-center bond orbitals between adjacent atoms. In the\nbond-orbital approximation,17,18 any property of occupied\nstates such as the total energy, charge density, or polarizabil-\nity can then be expressed as simply the sum of independent,\nshort-range terms for each bond. There are no long-range\nforces in this approximation, and the electron structure de-\npends only on short-range order.\np states are different, because a p orbital usually interacts\nwith p states on more than one atom to form a conjugated\nsystem such as benzene. Then, one can no longer deﬁne\nunique bond orbitals. Conjugated bonds cannot now be ex-\npressed as the sum of independent, two-center bonds. Each\nbond contains contributions from adjacent bonds, and this\ngives\nrise\nto\nlonger-range\nforces\nand\nlong-range\npolarizabilities.19\nThe medium-range order due to p-bonding distinguishes\ndisordered carbons from the s-bonded disordered semicon-\nductors like a-Si. p bonding is maximized if the p states\nform pairs of aligned p states, or sixfold aromatic rings or\ngraphitic clusters of aromatic rings.17 This occurs in micro-\ncrystalline graphite and in annealed DLC’s. However, as-\ndeposited DLC’s are more disordered than this ‘‘cluster\nmodel.’’ 20\nFigure 2~b! shows the band structure of a single graphite\nlayer.17 The s and p states act separately. The s states lie\nwell away from the Fermi level and have gap of 6 eV. p\nstates and empty p* states form bands that touch at the\nBrillouin zone K. The p band energies along GKM in\nnearest-neighbor tight-binding approximation are\nE56gu112 cos~ka!u,\n~1!\nwhere g is the ppp interaction, a is the lattice spacing, and\nk is the wave vector. In graphitic clusters, the p states have\nminimum band energies of roughly17\nEg'\n2g\nM 1/2 '2gS\na\nLaD ,\n~2!\nwhere M is the number of aromatic rings in the cluster and\nLa is the cluster diameter or in-plane correlation length.\nWe consider aromatic clusters as parts of a graphite su-\nperlattice. Hence, from Eqs. ~1! and ~2!, the energy states of\nthe clusters can be mapped onto those of graphite by\n112 cos~ka!52\na\nLa\n~3!\nor sin(Dka)'a/()La) for small Dk, where Dk is the k dis-\ntance away from K, and K5( 2\n3 , 2\n3 )p/a. Smaller clusters cor-\nrespond to k’s further away from K.\nThe long-range effects in conjugated systems can be for-\nmalized by deﬁning a mobile bond order Puv between two\norbitals19 u, v:\nPuv52(\nocc cucv\n~4!\nand a bond-bond polarizability Puv,wx between bonds uv and\nwx:\nPuv,wx5\n]2E\n]guv]gwx\n,\n~5!\nfor wave functions c5(cufu , where the sums are over\noccupied states.19 E is the sum of energies of occupied states\nand guv is the nearest-neighbor interaction along bond uv.\nThe difference between s and p states is that for s states\nPuv'0 if orbitals u and v are on different bonds, while in\nconjugated p systems, PuvÞ0, and it decreases gradually\nwith the separation of u and v.\nFIG. 2. ~a!

    "III. VIBRATIONAL MODES\nFigure 3 shows the vibrational density of states ~VDOS!\nof graphite and diamond.21–23 The VDOS of diamond ex-\ntends beyond its Raman frequency, 1332 cm21, to ;1360\ncm21. Figure 2~a! also shows the phonon dispersion curves\nof a graphite layer.21 The graphite VDOS extends beyond its\nG-point Raman frequency up to a band limit of ;1620 cm21,\ndue to the upwards phonon dispersion away from G. Graph-\nite has a higher VDOS band limit than diamond because the\nsp2 sites have stronger, slightly shorter bonds than sp3 sites.\nThe DOS of alloys can be of two types. If the coupling\nbetween sites is small, the alloys are in the atomic limit, so\nthe alloy DOS resembles a compositionally weighted mix-\nture of the DOS of each component. If the coupling is strong,\nthen the alloy DOS and the band limits interpolate smoothly\nbetween the two components. The Raman spectra suggest\nthat the VDOS of DLC’s are in the atomic limit, in that\nspeciﬁc features, such as the G mode of sp2 sites, remain at\nall sp2 contents. Thus, the band limit does not change lin-\nearly with sp3 content from 1600 to 1360 cm21. This is\npartly because sp2 sites tend to cluster in a sp3 matrix in\nDLC’s.17 A consequence is that the vibrations of sp2 sites\nremain around 1600 cm21 and lie above the band limit of the\nsp3 matrix. This causes these modes to be localized on the\nsp2 sites and above the extended modes of the sp3 matrix.24\nThe band limit thus cannot be used as a way to get the sp3\nfraction, as sometimes suggested.25 We therefore need a dif-\nferent approach in which the changes in the visible Raman\nspectra are related primarily to the changes of the sp2 phase\nand only weakly to the sp3 phase.\nThe vibrational modes of covalent solids are often mod-\neled as a valence force ﬁeld of bond-stretching and bond-\nbending forces. These forces are usually short-ranged for\ns-bonded systems.26 On the other hand, a valence force ﬁeld\nfor\ngraphite\ntypically\nuses\nforces\nup\nto\nﬁfth-nearest\nneighbors.27,28 Recently Mapelli et al.21 were able for the\nﬁrst time to provide a common force ﬁeld for aromatic mol-\necules and graphite by using forces proportional to the bond\norders Puv and bond-bond polarizabilities Puv,wx , Eqs. ~4!\nand ~5!. As P is directly related to the electronic structure\nand tight-binding parameter g, this method provides a formal\nrelationship between longer-range forces, so they are not just\nadjustable parameters.\nIV. RAMAN SCATTERING IN DISORDERED CARBON\nRaman modes in single crystals obey the fundamental se-\nlection rule q'0, where q is the wave vector of the scattered\nphonon. In a ﬁnite-size domain, the selection rule is relaxed\nto allow the participation of phonons near G, with Dq\n'2p/d, where d is the dimension of the crystalline domain.\nNemanich, Solin, and Martin29 ~NSM! showed that the Ra-\nman scattering intensity of a ﬁnite crystal is given by\nI~v!5\nn~v!11\nv\n(\nq,j C„q,v j~q!…uF~q!u2\n3\nG/2p\n@v2v j~q!#21G2/4,\n~6!\nwhere C„q,v j(q)… is the Raman coupling coefﬁcient for a\nphonon of wave vector q and branch j, and uF(q)u2 is the\nwave-vector uncertainty of the phonons involved in the light\nscattering. n(v)11 is the boson occupation factor, and G is\nthe phonon lifetime broadening. In amorphous materials, the\nwave-vector uncertainty is Dq'1/a, where a is the bond\nlength, and now all phonon modes can participate in the\nRaman spectrum. The intensity is now given by the matrix-\nelement-weighted vibrational density of states according to\nthe Shuker-Gammon formula30\nI~v!5\nn~v!11\nv\nC~v!G~v!.\n~7!\nHere, G(v) is the VDOS of the disordered network. Equa-\ntion ~7! describes quite well the Raman spectra of a-Si and\na-Ge, which are sp3 bonded only, by using a broadened\nversion of the crystalline VDOS as G(v).26\nThe visible Raman spectra of disordered carbons are in\nmarked contrast. The VDOS of disordered carbon with vari-\nous sp3 contents consists of smooth, broad features.31,32 In\ncontrast, the Raman spectra of all disordered carbons are\ndominated by the relatively sharp G and D features of the\nsp2 sites. This could be ascribed to the much greater cross\nsection of the p states.7,8 Nevertheless, the prevalence of G-\nand D-like features, even in amorphous carbons with little\ngraphitic ordering, requires explanation.\nThe G mode of graphite at 1581 cm21 has E2g symmetry.\nIts eigenvector shown in Fig. 4~a! involves the in-plane\nbond-stretching motion of pairs of C sp2 atoms. This mode\ndoes not require the presence of sixfold rings, and so it oc-\nFIG. 3.

    "curs at all sp2 sites, not only those in rings. It always lies in\nthe range 1500–1630 cm21, as it does in aromatic and ole-\nﬁnic molecules.33\nThe D peak around 1355 cm21 is a breathing mode of A1g\nsymmetry involving phonons near the K zone boundary, Fig.\n4~b!. This mode is forbidden in perfect graphite and only\nbecomes active in the presence of disorder. The D mode is\ndispersive; it varies with photon excitation energy, even\nwhen the G peak is not dispersive.34–37 We will see that its\nintensity is strictly connected to the presence of sixfold aro-\nmatic rings. Tuinstra and Koenig3 ~TK! noted that the ratio\nof its intensity to that of the G peak varied inversely with\nLa :\nI~D!\nI~G! 5\nC~l!\nLa\n,\n~8!\nwhere C(515.5 nm);44 Å.2,3,37 The D peak was ﬁrst attrib-\nuted to a A1g breathing mode at K, activated by the relax-\nation of the q50 selection rule.3 It was then linked to\nmaxima in the VDOS of graphite at M and K points.4,27\nHowever, this does not account for the dispersion of the D\nposition with photon energy, why the D peak overtone, seen\neven where no D peak is present, is dispersive, or why the\nI(D)/I(G) ratio ~8! is dispersive.34 Phonon conﬁnement ~6!\ndoes not explain why the D mode is more intense than others\nwith smaller Dq. It also does not explain why the D mode is\nseen in disordered graphite with La'30 nm,6 when the NSM\nformula ~6! would limit the participating phonons to a much\nnarrower Dq range around G.\nFigure 2~a! shows the phonon dispersion of a single layer\nof graphite. Baranov et al.,35 Pocsik et al.,36 and Matthews\net al.37 proposed that the D peak arises as resonant Raman\ncoupling by a strong enhancement of the Raman cross sec-\ntion of the phonon of wave vector q, when it equals the wave\nvector k of the electronic transition excited by the incident\nphoton (k5q ‘‘selection rule’’!.\nWe now give a more detailed account. In particular, we\npropose a physical mechanism to explain the k5q ‘‘quasi\nselection rule;’’ we identify a different branch in the disper-\nsion relation as the origin of D peak ~in contrast to Refs. 36\nand 37!. We formally show which real-space motions give\nrise to the D peak, and we propose, on the basis of the\n‘‘quasi selection rule,’’ an interpretation to some experimen-\ntal ﬁndings.\nRaman scattering is the inelastic scattering of photons by\nphonons due to the change of polarization caused by the\nphonon mode.38 When the photon energy is above the band\ngap, electrons of all wave vectors can be excited. However,\nin graphite, the band gap lies in the visible range only within\na small part of k space around the K point, Fig. 2~b!. All\nthese bands have p character. In this case, photons reso-\nnantly excite states only at the k vector where the band gap\nequals the photon energy. This sets up a polarization density\nwave of this k vector. Its intensity is strong because of the\nlong-range polarizability of p states.\nThe change of bond polarization with bond length is by\nfar the dominant term in the Raman matrix element for p\nstates.26 This term is large for the breathing mode of sixfold\nrings. By symmetry, for a breathing mode of a graphite\nplane, the contributions from each ring add constructively\nbecause of the long-range polarization. On the other hand, by\nsymmetry, contributions from rings of other orders within a\ngraphite plane tend to cancel. Thus, the polarization wave\nand Raman coupling have long-range coherence for breath-\ning modes due to the p bonding and the symmetry of the\ngraphite sheet. The greatest coupling is when the electron\nand phonon states are in phase over the range of polarization.\nThis leads to the ‘‘quasi selection rule,’’ k5q, for the\nbreathing modes of graphene sheets, Fig. 2. For ﬁrst-order\nscattering, the fundamental selection rule must be relaxed to\nallow non-(q50) phonons to contribute. This means that we\nalso need disorder to allow the enhancement of k5q\nphonons.\nTurning to graphitic clusters, we noted above that the\nelectronic states of graphitic clusters of size La can be\nmapped onto the modes of graphite at wave vector k by Eq.\n~3!. Mapelli et al.21 showed that the eigenvectors of the main\nRaman modes of aromatic oligomers have the same symme-\ntry as the E2g and A1g Raman modes of graphite. They also\nshowed that the eigenvectors of these oligomers or clusters\ncan be mapped onto those of graphite phonons along the\ndirection GKM. In particular, the A1g-type breathing modes\nof the aromatic clusters map onto phonons between K and\n(K2M)/2, and the E2g-type modes map onto phonons from\nG to (G2K)/4 ~branches shown in bold in Fig. 2!. Our rela-\ntionship ~3! can be used to map the A1g-like modes, thus\nproviding a way to visualize the real-space motion along that\nbranch. This indicates that aromatic clusters can be consid-\nered as a part of a graphite superlattice, both electronically\nand vibrationally. This simultaneous mapping means that the\nbehavior and dispersion of the D and G peaks in graphite\nalso holds for aromatic oligomers and clusters in disordered\ncarbon.\nBand and phonon dispersions are rather isotropic around\nK. As the photon energy rises, the k5q selection rule selects\na ring of phonons around the K point. The symmetric breath-\ning modes have the highest modulation of the polarizability\nand therefore have the highest Raman cross section. This\nsuggests that modes between K and M give the highest con-\nFIG. 4. Carbon motions in the ~a! G and ~b! D modes.

    "tribution to the D peak and possibly explains why the inten-\nsity of D peak is higher than modes from other branches of\nthe dispersion curves but with the same q. Note that previous\nworks36,37 assigned the D peak to all the modes around K in\nthe lower optical branch, which touches the acoustic branch\nat K. To select the correct optical branch we cannot just rely\non the coincidence between its calculated dispersion and the\nexperimental positions of D peak. The A1g mode is singly\ndegenerate. We thus need a band singly degenerate at K and\nupwards dispersing away from K. The branch chosen by\nRefs. 36 and 37 leads to a doubly degenerate E mode at K.21\nThe upper branch in Ref. 37 disperses downwards, but the ab\ninitio calculations of Mapelli et al.21 and Kresse, Furth-\nmuller, and Hafner22 reproduce the symmetry and upwards\ndispersion, Fig. 2.\nApplying the k5q selection rule to all the phonon\nbranches of graphite, we can account for other features of the\nRaman spectrum. First, considering the ;2400-cm21 peak as\nan overtone of the lower acoustic branch away from K, we\ncan explain its redshift39 with increasing laser energy due to\nthe opposite dispersion of this phonon branch. Second, a\nStokes shift with lower frequency than the anti-Stokes shift\nwas reported for the D peak, and vice versa for the\n2400-cm21 peak.39 We can now explain the slight difference\nin the Stokes and anti-Stokes energies due to the slope of the\nphonon and electron dispersion relations away from K. Fi-\nnally, in graphite or disordered graphite with a high c-axis\nordering,\nthe\nD\npeak\nand\nits\nsecond-order\npeak\nare\ndoublets.6,34,39 This was originally attributed to two maxima\nin the VDOS at K and M.27 However, we attribute these\ndoublets to the splitting of phonon and electron branches of\ngiven wave vector by interlayer interactions when three-\ndimensional stacking occurs.21,35 This causes doublets to act\nas signatures of c-axis ordering.6\nSo far we implicitly assumed graphite to be the reference\nto explain the Raman features in micro/nanocrystalline\ngraphite. The main consequence is that the D peak arises\nfrom aromatic rings. Starting from graphite, at a ﬁxed l,\nI(D)/I(G) will increase with increasing disorder, according\nto TK Eq. ~8!. For more disorder, clusters decrease in num-\nber become smaller and more distorted, until they open up.\nAs the G peak is just related to the relative motion of C sp2\natoms, the I(D) will now decrease with respect to I(G) and\nthe TK relationship will no longer hold, as shown in Fig. 5.\nFor small La , the D-mode strength is proportional to the\nprobability of ﬁnding a sixfold ring in the cluster, that is,\nproportional to the cluster area. Thus, in amorphous carbons\nthe development of a D peak indicates ordering, exactly op-\nposite from the case of graphite.\nWe can ﬁnally summarize the main factors modifying\nC(v):\n~1! sp2 sites are resonantly enhanced over sp3 ones,\n~2! within the sp2 matrix, q5k modes are enhanced over\nthe others, and\n~3! breathing modes are enhanced within q5k modes.\nV. SPECTRUM FITTING\nA practical point when comparing different ﬁtting param-\neters for Raman spectra is to know the ﬁtting procedures\nused. The Raman spectrum is a VDOS modiﬁed by a cou-\npling coefﬁcient, which incorporates various resonances.\nThere is no a priori reason to choose a particular function to\nﬁt the spectrum. Empirically, the visible Raman spectra of\namorphous carbons show one or two prominent features ~the\nG and D peaks! and some minor modulations ~usually\naround 1100–1200 and 1400–1500 cm21!. The simplest ﬁt\nconsists of two Lorentzians or two Gaussians. A Lorentzian\nﬁt is often used for crystals, arising from ﬁnite lifetime\nbroadening, and it is normally used for disordered graphite.\nA Gaussian line shape is expected for a random distribution\nof phonon lifetimes in disordered materials. A simple two-\nsymmetric-line ﬁt is not always suitable, and one can ﬁnd a\nmultipeak ﬁt ~typically four: D,G12 at ;1100 and ;1400\ncm21!.\nThe most widely used alternative to a Gaussian ﬁt is a\nBreit-Wigner-Fano ~BWF! line for the G peak and a Lorent-\nzian for the D peak.40–42 The BWF line has an asymmetric\nline shape, which should arise from the coupling of a discrete\nmode to a continuum.43 The BWF line shape is given by\nI~v!5\nI0@112~v2v0!/QG#2\n11@2~v2v0!/G#2\n,\n~9!\nwhere I0 is the peak intensity, v0 is the peak position, G is\nassumed as the full width at half maximum ~FWHM! and\nQ21 is the BWF coupling coefﬁcient. The Lorentzian line\nshape is recovered in the limit Q21→0. We emphasize that\nseveral points should be considered with Eq. ~9!. First, the\nBWF curve tails increasingly to lower frequencies for lower\nQ values. This allows a BWF line to account for residual\nRaman intensity at ;1100 and 1400 cm21, without two extra\npeaks. The BWF1Lorentzian line pair is therefore an excel-\nlent means to ﬁt Raman spectra of all carbons, from graphite\nto ta-C. A Lorentzian line shape is used for the D peak as it\nis from the same family as the BWF line, while the various\nenhancement mechanisms for the D peak are consistent with\na Lorentzian. However, any wide low-frequency tail of the\nBWF line will push the D peak to lower frequencies as the\ndisorder increases. This signiﬁcantly decreases the D peak\nsize compared to a two-Gaussian ﬁt. In general, the D-peak\nposition will decrease with increasing disorder with the\nBWF1Lorentzian ﬁt, but will increase ~up to 1400 cm21 or\nmore! for the double-Gaussian ﬁt.9,10,13 Note that the ﬁt of\nthe D peak and especially its position is the least accurate for\nFIG. 5.

    "many amorphous carbons, because it is often only a low-\nfrequency shoulder of the G peak. Two factors can shift the\nD peak. On one hand, smaller aromatic clusters have higher\nmodes21 and shift D upwards. On the other hand, a decrease\nin number of ordered aromatic rings on passing from nano-\ncrystalline graphite to a-C lowers D and reduces its intensity,\ndue to softening of the VDOS.44\nAnother important issue from Eq. ~9! is that the maximum\nof the BWF line is not at v0 but lies at lower frequencies:\nvmax5v01\nG\n2Q ,\n~10!\nas Q is negative. We deﬁne the G position as vmax rather\nthan v0 .\nv0 is higher than the apparent peak maximum\nbecause v0 is the position of the undamped mode.43 We\nattribute no physical meaning to the undamped frequency but\nmerely view the BWF line as an efﬁcient way to ﬁt the data.\nThe asymmetric BWF line shape is appropriate for the G\npeak due to the asymmetry of the VDOS of graphite or\namorphous carbons towards lower wave numbers.9 No Fano\nresonance is present. Whenever reporting data from other\npapers using BWF ﬁts, we will use vmax, derived by apply-\ning Eq. ~10! to their data. Moreover, vmax compares directly\nwith data from symmetric curve ﬁtting.\nFinally, it is not always clear if the I(D)/I(G) ratio\nshould be the ratio of the peak heights or peak areas. Gener-\nally, groups using BWF1Lorentzian ﬁts report peak height\nratios, while groups using two Gaussians report the area ra-\ntio. The difference is not so important for disordered graph-\nite, as the peak widths are similar, but this is not so for\namorphous carbons. In that case, the broadening of the D\npeak is correlated to a distribution of clusters with different\norders and dimensions, and thus the information about the\nless distorted aromatic rings is in the intensity maximum and\nnot in the width, which depends on the disorder. Ring orders\nother that six tend to decrease the peak height and increase\nits width. Unless differently stated, in this paper we refer to\nI(D)/I(G) as the ratio of peak heights.\nVI. THREE-STAGE MODEL\nThe large amount of experimental visible Raman spectra\non amorphous carbons will be interpreted using a phenom-\nenological three-stage model. Given a perfect, inﬁnite graph-\nite sheet, we consider the introduction of a series of defects:\nbond-angle disorder, bond-length disorder, and hybridiza-\ntion. We neglect the possible role of hydrogen, as C-H\nmodes give no detectable contributions in the G and D peaks\n~Sec. VIII!.

    "These effects, at a ﬁxed wavelength, can be explained by\nthe VDOS of graphite and phonon conﬁnement.5,6 First, the\nshift of G is really the appearance of a second peak, D8, at\n;1620 cm21, which merges in the G peak for small grains.\nA single line ﬁt to G1D8 feature gives a net increase of G\nposition. The appearance of D8 occurs because the relaxation\nof the q50 selection rule allows higher-frequency phonons,\nas phonons disperse upwards away from G; see Figs. 2 and 3.\nThe main structural change is passing from a monocrystal-\nline to a polycrystalline material; there are virtually no sp3\nsites. The loss of three-dimensional ordering is indicated by\nthe disappearance of the doublet in the D peak and in its\nsecond-order peak.6 There are many experimental results\nshowing\nstage\n1,\nsuch\nas\nthose\nfrom\nLespade\nand\nco-workers.5,6\nWe note that there are only few experimental veriﬁcations\nof the TK equation ~8!, where La is known independently by\nx-ray diffraction ~XRD!,2 and the minimum La for which the\nTK equation has been directly veriﬁed is ;20 Å.\nTK as-\nsumes that graphite becomes uniformly nanocrystalline.\nHowever, for a system with mixed grain sizes, with volume\nfractions Xi and dimensions Lai , the effective La is given by\n1\nLa,eff\n5(\ni\nN\nXi\n1\nLai\n.\n~11!\nWe can thus explain why, since XRD weights more the big-\nger crystallites, the TK equation will underestimate La due to\nthe dominant effect of small crystallites.46\nB. Stage 2: From nanocrystalline graphite to a-C\nIn this stage, defects are progressively introduced into the\ngraphite layer, causing its phonon modes to soften, particu-\nlarly the G peak. The Shuker-Gammon formula ~7! applies,\nand the VDOS is no longer that of graphite. The end of stage\n2 corresponds to a completely disordered, almost fully\nsp2-bonded a-C consisting of distorted sixfold rings or rings\nof other orders ~maximum 20% sp3). A typical example is\nsputtered a-C.47 The main effects in the evolution of the\nRaman spectrum are\n~a! The G peak decreases from 1600 to ;1510 cm21.\n~b! The TK equation is no longer valid: I(D)/I(G)}M\n}La\n2.\n~c! I(D)/I(G)→0.\n~d! Increasing dispersion of the G peak occurs.\nAnother effect is the absence of well-deﬁned second-order\nRaman peaks, but a small modulated bump from ;2400 to\n;3100 cm21.\nIncreasing bond-angle and bond-bending disorder and the\npresence of nonsixfold rings softens the VDOS.44,24 The in-\ntroduction of sp3 sites into a structure composed only of\nsixfold rings further softens the VDOS.24,44\nIncreasing the defects and reducing La below 2 nm, the\nnumber of ordered rings now decreases and I(D) starts to\ndecrease. The G peak relates only to bond stretching of sp2\npairs, so G retains its intensity, and I(D)/I(G) decreases\nwith increasing amorphization ~Fig. 5!. The TK equation is\nno longer valid. This is the usual situation with a-C. Devel-\nopment of the D peak indicates disordering of graphite but\nordering of a-C. This is expressed in effect ~b! by the pro-\nportionality of I(D)/I(G) to M, the number of ordered rings.\nIn fact, I(D)/I(G) is proportional to the number and clus-\ntering of rings, but the main disordering effect in stage 2 can\nbe taken as the decrease of number of ordered rings, since\nthe dimensions are under 20 Å. We propose a new relation\nfor stage 2:\nI~D!\nI~G! 5C8~l!La\n2.\n~12!\nImposing continuity between Eqs. ~8! and ~12!, we ﬁnd\nC8(514 nm)'0.0055. At low excitation energy, the D peak\nis due to large aromatic clusters. Thus, combining Eqs. ~2!\nand ~12!, I(D)/I(G) will vary with the optical gap as\nI~D!\nI~G! 5\nC9\nEg\n2 .\n~13!\nWe have veriﬁed Eq. ~13! by studying the clustering of sp2\nsites in ta-C deposited at elevated temperatures.48 It is clear\nthat this is an ideal situation in which thermal energy favors\nthe clustering of the sp2 phase into ordered rings, and so Eq.\n~13! holds. This is not so in general, especially for as-\ndeposited samples, where the ion-induced disorder in the sp2\nphase invalidates the simple relation ~2! between cluster size\nand band gap.20 In fact, as we will discuss in Sec. VI C, in\ngoing from as-deposited a-C’s to ta-C we have always\nI(D)/I(G);0, but the gap increases. However, we stress\nthat for visible Raman spectroscopy, whenever a D peak is\npresent @I(D)/I(G)>0.1–0.2#, a decrease of the gap will\nalways be reﬂected in an increase of I(D)/I(G), even if not\nexactly in the form of Eq. ~13!. We will discuss elsewhere\nthe progressive insensitivity of I(D)/I(G) to the gap with\nincreasing excitation energy.\nClear experimental examples of stage 2 are the ion im-\nplantation of glassy carbon40,41 ~g-C! and sputtered a-C.49,31\nFigure 8 plots data of McCulloch and co-workers40,41 on ion\nimplantation of g-C at room temperature as a function of ion\ndose @Fig. 8~a!# and at a ﬁxed dose with increasing implan-\ntation temperature @Fig. 8~b!#. We show the ﬁrst and second\nstages of amorphization. The sp3 content was checked by\nEELS and it rose to 15% only at the very end of stage 2. An\nNMR determination of sp3 content in sputtered a-C with the\nG peak at ;1500 cm21 and I(D)/I(G);0 gave sp3\n;7%.47,31\nThe structure of a-C at the end of stage 2 consists of\nmainly sp2 sites in puckered ring-like conﬁgurations ~con-\nsisting of ﬁve-, six-, seven-, and eightfold disordered rings!,\nand few if any sp3 sites.47,44,50,51 Li and Lannin47 showed an\nabsence of ordered, planar sixfold rings @consistent with\nI(D)/I(G);0] and few chainlike structures.\nC. Stage 3: From a-C to ta-C\nIn passing from a-C to ta-C, the sp3 content rises from\n;10–20 % to ;85%, while the sp2 sites change gradually\nfrom rings to chains. The p states become increasingly lo-\ncalized on oleﬁnic sp2 chains and, eventually, sp2 dimers\nembedded in the sp3 matrix.24,51–54,15 The sp2 modes lie\nabove the sp3 modes and become localized.24 Oleﬁnic CvC\nbonds are shorter than aromatic bonds, so they have higher\nPRB 61\n14 101\nINTERPRETATION OF RAMAN SPECTRA OF . . .\n",
    "vibration frequencies.33,55 The main effects in the evolution\nof the Raman spectrum are as follows.\n~a! The G peak increases from ;1510 to ;1570 cm21 ~or\n;1630\ncm21\nfor\nsp2\ndimers\nin\nion-implanted\ndiamond.45!\n~b! I(D)/I(G) is very low or 0.\n~c! Dispersion of the G peak occurs.\nThe main change, i.e., the increase of the G-peak position\nwith sp3 content, is due to the change of sp2 conﬁguration\nfrom rings to oleﬁnic groups, with their higher vibrational\nfrequencies lying above the band limit of graphite. This ef-\nfect is larger than the tendency of the G peak to fall due to\nmixing with lower-frequency sp3 modes. This emphasizes\nthe importance of the localization of sp2 modes above the\nsp3 modes, which minimizes the mixing of sp2 with sp3\nmodes. It follows that the model of Richter et al.25 does not\nhold in practice.\nThe second major change is the absence of a D peak in a\nBWF ﬁt. The G skewness falls to almost 0 at high sp3\ncontent.42 Also, the G-peak width ﬁrst increases and then\nfalls, as the G modes become localized on sp2 dimers or\nshorter sp2 chains with a sharper length distribution. A\nsingle-Gaussian ﬁt is poor, although it still gives a fair rep-\nresentation of peak position and FWHM.56\nIt has been argued that the high frequency of the G peak\nin ta-C is due to its high compressive macroscopic stress.56,14\nWe disagree with this, as it is found that the G peak does not\nmove if the stress is removed by annealing.57–59 We veriﬁed\nthat annealing up to complete stress release induces minimal\nstructural changes in ta-C.57 Also, the G peak of ta-C is\nblueshifted in both uv Raman spectra ~;1660 cm21, com-\npared to ;1590 cm21 for sp2-bonded a-C! and 514-nm Ra-\nman spectra ~;1570 cm21 compared to ;1510 cm21!. This\ndispersion can only be fully explained by contributions of\noleﬁnic sp2 groups, whose higher vibration frequencies lie\nabove the graphite band limit.15 Tallant et al.60 suggested to\nﬁt the Raman spectra of as-deposited ta-C using the frequen-\ncies of embedded ideal ﬁve-, six-, and sevenfold sp2 rings.\nSuch a model, even if very good ﬁts are obtained for the\n514-nm Raman spectra, cannot explain the dispersion above\n;1580 cm21 seen in the uv Raman spectra and is thus in-\ncorrect for ta-C. uv Raman spectroscopy gives not only an\nevenly weighted probe of sp3 and sp2 sites, but also an\nevenly weighted probe of ring and chain sp2 modes, not\nbiased towards sp2 conﬁgurations of lower band gap. It\nshows a G peak at 1660 cm21 in ta-C, indicating a prepon-\nderance of chain groups.\nFigure 9 shows our 514-nm Raman data on ta-C depos-\nited by a ﬁltered cathodic vacuum arc ~FCVA!, together with\ndata of Prawer et al.42 and Anders and co-workers59,56 on\n(t)a-C deposited by FCVA. We only included data with sp3\ncontent known by EELS. Figure 9 is a clear example of the\ntransition from stage 2 to stage 3 in accordance with the\nabove trends. Note the absence of the D peak in ta-C’s. Al-\nthough I(D)/I(G);0, typically we have an increase in the\ngap from ;0.5 to ;2.5 eV, going from a-C to ta-C. This\nwould contradict Eq. ~13!. However, this is expected since\nthe gap is controlled by the p-electron delocalization, not\nnecessarily in well-ordered rings, but on the whole sp2\nphase. An increasing sp2 content, even if not via an ordered\nsp2 matrix, causes a decrease of the gap reﬂected in a soft-\nening of the G mode and an increase in its FWHM.\nFigure 7 summarized the behavior of G peak position and\nI(D)/I(G) through all the three stages. It shows no unique\nFIG. 8.

    "relationship between the G-peak position and sp3 content.\nG-peak position can either increase or decrease with increas-\ning sp3 and a high and low sp3 content corresponds to the\nsame G position. I(D)/I(G) would discriminate, between\nhigh and low content and, except for the ﬁrst stage, in which\nsp3 is constant anyway, it would be a crucial parameter to\nquantify the sp3 phase. Figure 7 also emphasizes that most\nchanges of the Raman spectra are not driven by the sp3\nincrease, but by the evolution of sp2 clusters.\nFigure 7 shows how we could relate the @G,I(D)/I(G)#\npair to sp3 content. However, the situation is more complex\nthan described so far, as the clustering of the sp2 phase has\nto be taken directly into account, as we discuss now.\nVII. THE HYSTERESIS CYCLE\nThe amorphization trajectory discussed above is derived\nfor disordering ~e.g., ion implantation! in relatively ordered\ncarbons or for room-temperature depositions. What happens\nif we follow an ordering trajectory from ta-C to graphite?\nExamples of an ordering trajectory are deposition at high\ntemperature, annealing after deposition, low-dose ion im-\nplantation of ta-C, or unﬁltered deposition processes. These\ncases favor clustering of sp2 sites into fairly ordered aro-\nmatic rings.\nThere are two fundamental processes: ~a! sp3 sites con-\nvert to sp2 sites and ~b! sp2 cluster size increases and the\nsp2 phase eventually orders in rings. There are two situa-\ntions. During a room-temperature deposition of ta-C, the sp2\nand sp3 phases are linked together, forcing the sp2 phase to\nevolve continuously with increasing sp3 content, giving the\ntrends seen in Fig. 7. On the other hand, other treatments,\nsuch as annealing or high-temperature deposition, separate\nthe two processes so that clustering ~b! occurs at lower tem-\nperatures than conversion ~a!.48,57 This causes hysteresis.\nVisible Raman spectroscopy is much more sensitive to clus-\ntering than conversion. The effect of the hysteresis is that\nthere is no unique relation between I(D)/I(G) or the G po-\nsition and sp3 fraction ~Fig. 10!. Thus, we need an indepen-\ndent assessment of the sp3 fraction. Fundamentally, optical\nand electrical properties correlate closely with the degree of\nsp2 clustering, and not directly with the sp3 content. This\nimplies that in general visible Raman spectroscopy is not a\nsafe way to get sp3 content. Various examples of hysteresis\ncan be found in the literature;14,48,57,61,62 see Fig. 11.\nWe have so far neglected the presence of sp1 bonds,\nwhose C-C vibrations at 2100–2200 cm21 ~Ref. 33! lie out-\nside the G and D regions. Even if present in a small amount,\nthis does not change our model.\nGenerally, in an inhomogeneous material we predict the\nTK equation to underestimate La with respect to XRD, as for\nEq. ~11!. This gives a hysteresis even in stage 1, in that\nvisible Raman spectroscopy is more sensitive to the smaller\ngraphitic domains in a material not composed of grains hav-\ning a similar La .\nAre there conditions for estimating sp3 content by visible\nRaman spectroscopy? Figures 7 and 9 show that a high\nG-peak position combined with a I(D)/I(G);0 is a sufﬁ-\ncient condition to assess the sp3 content of ta-C. In this case,\nthe sp3 content can be read off from Fig. 9~a!. Here, a higher\nG position correlates with a higher optical gap.\nVIII. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VISIBLE RAMAN\nSPECTRA AND THE sp3 FRACTION IN a-C:H\nMore generally, if there is a relationship between sp2 and\nsp3 phases, e.g., between the optical gap and sp3 fraction,\nwe can derive sp3 content from the visible Raman spectra.\nWe apply this idea to derive a correlation between visible\nRaman spectra and sp3 content for a-C:H.\nThe main effect of H in a-C:H is to modify its C-C net-\nwork compared to a-C of similar sp3 content. A higher sp3\ncontent is achieved mainly by H saturating CvC bonds as\nwCHx groups, rather than by increasing the fraction of\nC—C bonds ~Fig. 1!. Most sp3 sites are bonded to\nhydrogen.63,64 Thus, highly sp3 a-C:H are soft, low-density,\npolymeric ﬁlms.63,64 In a-C:H the sp2 sites can exist as rings\nas well as chains. Increasing H content reduces the sp2 clus-\nter size and increases the band gap. We have three bonding\nregimes.1,63 At low H content, sp2 bonding dominates and\nthe gap is under 1 eV. At intermediate H content, the C-C\nsp3 bonding is a maximum, the ﬁlms have the highest den-\nsity and diamondlike character, and the gap is 1–1.8 eV. At\nhighest H contents, the sp3 content is highest, the bonding is\nmore polymeric, and the band gap is over 1.8 eV. ta-C:H\ndiffers in that a higher sp3 fraction occurs at a ﬁxed, lower H\ncontent of 25–30 % ~Fig. 1!. ta-C:H has much more C-C sp3\nbonding than a-C:H with similar sp3 fraction, giving a\nhigher density and higher hardness.65\nIn visible Raman spectra, we can neglect all C-H modes.\nThe stretching modes lie above 3000 cm21.64 C-H bending\nmodes lie in the D-peak region,33,64 but we neglect them\nbecause they are not resonantly enhanced. This is supported\nby a similar behavior for D and G peaks with changing ex-\ncitation energy found in a-C:H and a-C.10,11 C-H modes\nFIG. 10. Amorphization trajectory, showing the possibility of\nhysteresis in stages 2 and 3.\nPRB 61\n14 103\nINTERPRETATION OF RAMAN SPECTRA OF . . .\n",
    "could become detectable at much higher photon energy, such\nas that in uv Raman spectroscopy. A typical signature of\nhydrogenated samples is the increasing photoluminescence\nbackground with increasing H content. This background\novershadows the Raman signal of a-C:H with H content over\n;40–45 at. %66 The ratio between the slope m of the ﬁtted\nlinear background and the intensity of the G peak, m/I(G),\ncould be used as a measure of the bonded H content.66\nWe derive and explain the relation between visible Raman\nparameters and sp3 content for a-C:H deposited by plasma-\nenhanced chemical vapor deposition ~PECVD!. From Tamor\nand Vassel13 we obtain a general relation between 514-nm\nRaman parameters and the optical gap for as-deposited\na-C:H ~Fig. 12!. I(D)/I(G) is now an area ratio of a two-\nGaussian ﬁt @thus giving I(D)/I(G) up to ;4, in contrast to\n;2 obtained with the intensity ratio in a BWF1Lorentzian\nﬁt#. Figure 12~a! shows that the G peak falls with increasing\ngap for a-C:H, differently from ta-C, although the gap in-\ncreases with sp3 content in both materials. The reasons for\nthe difference is that in a-C:H the CvC stretching frequen-\ncies tend to fall towards the lower values of under 1500\ncm21 seen in polyacetylene,33,55 whereas in ta-C the CvC\nstretching frequency tends to rise towards that of the embed-\nded CvC dimer at 1630 cm21. The mixing with sp3 modes\nalso helps to lower the G peak in a-C:H.\nFor as-deposited a-C:H, there is a general relationship\nbetween sp2 content and optical gap;67 see Fig. 13. The line\nin Fig. 13 is a ﬁt to the experimental data. Applying the\nﬁtting line to the data of Fig. 12, we obtain the relationship\nbetween sp3 content and Raman parameters shown in Fig.\n14. The crosses in Fig. 14 are for samples whose sp3 content\nwas directly measured ~Ref. 68! by NMR or EELS ~this\nwork!. They agree with the sp3 content derived by Raman\nspectroscopy. Thus Raman spectroscopy is a valuable\nmethod to obtain sp3 content for as-deposited a-C:H. Fig-\nures 12–14 will be improved by a further systematic study.\nFigure 14 also shows Raman and sp3 data for ta-C:H\nﬁlms deposited by an electron cyclotron wave resonance\nsource from C2H2.65 The G peak of ta-C:H is seen to lie\nabove that of a-C:H of similar sp3 content ~gap!. These data\nshow how the transition between the second and third stage\nalso occurs in a-C:H, indicating how the three-stage model\napplies to both unhydrogenated and hydrogenated carbons.\nIt is important to note that the G peak in a-C:H and\n(t)a-C shows dispersion with photon energy, in both cases\nFIG. 11. G position and I(D)/I(G) ratio data showing the hys-\nteresis effect. Data on as deposited ta-C, from Prawer et al. ~Ref.\n42!, this work, and Anders and co-workers ~Refs. 56 and 59!.

    "increasing for higher photon energies.10–12,15,16 Thus, the re-\nlations between the G position and gap or sp3 fraction of\nFigs. 9, 12, and 14 apply for 514-nm excitation. The in-\ncreased G position with increased excitation arises from the\nresonant selection of wider-band gap p states from sp2\ngroups with higher vibration frequency. This leads to a lower\nsensitivity of the G position and I(D)/I(G) to optical gaps\nwith higher excitation energy,12 since the optical gap is due\nto the more delocalized p-bonded structures.17 This would\nsuggest that red Raman spectroscopy is preferable to the tra-\nditional green or blue spectroscopy to better exploit the abil-\nity of visible Raman spectra to follow the ﬁne variations of\noptical gap on sp2 order.\nThe width of the G peak is proportional to the bond-angle\ndisorder at sp2 sites. Figure 15 plots the G width (DG)\nagainst the optical gap for as-deposited a-C:H.13 It is seen\nthat DG passes through a maximum at around 1.5 eV for\na-C:H, which corresponds to ﬁlms of maximum C-C sp3 or\n‘‘diamondlike’’ content.\nAs the skeletal structure of a-C:H depends strongly on its\nH content, we expect a strict relation between the H content\nand C-C structure during annealing of a-C:H. We therefore\nexpect only a small hysteresis of the Raman parameters dur-\ning annealing of a-C:H compared to the case of ta-C. Thus,\nrelations in Figs. 12 and 14 are valid for both as-deposited\nand annealed a-C:H ﬁlms. However, we expect hysteresis for\nta-C:H.\nIX. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have reviewed and critically assessed the origin and\nthe meaning of the D and G peaks in the Raman spectra of\ngraphite and amorphous carbons. We pointed out that the G\npeak is due to the relative motion of sp2 carbon atoms, while\nthe D peak is linked to breathing modes of rings. We showed\nhow the electronic and vibration states of sp2 aromatic clus-\nters can be mapped onto those of graphite. The Raman spec-\ntra depend formally on the ordering of the sp2 sites, due to\nthe resonant enhancement of their vibrations. We are able to\nclassify all the available visible Raman data by considering\nthe effect of a three-stage introduction of disorder into graph-\nite on its Raman spectrum. We showed how this description\napplies both to hydrogen-free and hydrogenated amorphous\ncarbons.\nFIG. 14. G position and I(D)/I(G) ratio vs sp3 fraction for\nas-deposited a-C:H.

    "The ability to deduce sp3 content from the visible Raman\nspectra depends on the linkage of sp2 and sp3 phases. In\nH-free (t)a-C, the clustering of sp2 only depends on sp3\ncontent as-deposited, but generally not in ﬁlms annealed, de-\nposited at higher temperatures, or ion implanted. Thus, the\nsp3 content can be deduced from their Raman spectra only\nfor as-deposited ta-C. The C-C network of a-C:H depends\nstrongly on its hydrogen content, which links the sp2 and\nsp3 phases together. This allows the sp3 content of a-C:H to\nbe derived from the 514-nm Raman spectra. A relationship\nwas given between the G-peak position, I(D)/I(G), and sp3\ncontent.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to C. Mapelli and C. Castiglioni\nfor useful discussions. A. C.
