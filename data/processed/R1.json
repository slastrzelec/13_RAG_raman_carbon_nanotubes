Introduction\nRaman spectroscopy is widely used for the\ncharacterization of carbonaceous materials (CM)\nof geological interest. In the last years, Raman\nspectroscopy has been used to study CM in natural\nsamples like metamorphic rocks [1\u0001/5], cratonic\nlithospheric mantle [6], rocks impacted by meteor-\nites [7], fluid inclusions [8,9] and interplanetary\nCM particles in meteorities [10,11]. Moreover,\nRaman spectroscopy has been used for the study\nof synthetic CM recovered from high-temperature\n(HT) or high-pressure, high-temperature (HP\u0001/\nHT) experiments, these products exhibiting a\nsimilar structural organization to that observed\nwithin natural CM [12\u0001/14].\nRaman spectroscopy is now recognized as a\nmore appropriate tool than X-ray diffraction\n(XRD) for the study of such natural CM [1,14].\nFirst, Raman spectroscopy has a higher spatial\nresolution and so provides less averaged informa-\n* Corresponding author.

    "tion. By contrast with conventional XRD which\nrequires the extraction of CM, Raman microspec-\ntroscopy allows to perform in situ measurements\nwithin thin sections. Moreover, recent technical\ndevelopments have reduced the spectrum acquisi-\ntion duration from several hours per point [1,12] to\na few minutes.\nHowever, natural CM is generally disordered\nbut also structurally, microtexturally and textu-\nrally heterogeneous. This problem of heterogeneity\nhas been rarely discussed in the studies cited\nabove, though it is an intrinsic parameter of the\ngraphitization process under pressure. This hetero-\ngeneity is actually a consequence of both the\ninitiation and the propagation of the graphitiza-\ntion within CM. The problem is that this hetero-\ngeneity can constitute a severe limitation to a\nquantitative characterization of these materials\nfrom the nm to the mm scales [14].\nThe aim of this paper is to review and discuss\nthe applicability of Raman spectroscopy methods\nto characterize disordered CM, including the\nwithin-sample\nheterogeneity.\nIn\nthis\npurpose,\nboth natural and synthetic CM are considered,\nproviding a large and various dataset of reference\nsamples for the discussion.\n2. Analytical strategy\n2.1. Samples\nBoth natural and synthetic samples are consid-\nered in this study. The natural samples come from\nseveral reference metamorphic belts and have\nundergone regional metamorphism from high-\ntemperature, low-pressure (HT\u0001/LP) to high-pres-\nsure, low-temperature (HP\u0001/LT) metamorphic gra-\ndients. These samples have been already studied by\nRaman microspectroscopy and/or HRTEM [4,5].\nThe synthetic samples were obtained from various\nexperiments with hydrostatic pressure up to 8 GPa\nand temperature up to 1473 K, with three organic\nprecursors as starting material: a saccharose-based\nand an anthracene-based cokes, and an anthracite\nas a possible precursor of natural graphite. These\nsamples have been studied by Raman spectro-\nscopy, XRD and HRTEM [14]. All these samples\nconstitute an extensive dataset of reference sam-\nples to discuss the applicability of Raman spectro-\nscopy.\nMore\ndetails\nconcerning\nthe\nscientific\nconclusions from the study of these samples can\nbe found in the papers given in reference.\nThe characterization of the natural samples was\nperformed by Raman microspectroscopy in situ\nusing conventional petrologic polished thin sec-\ntions. These sections have a thickness at least equal\nto 30 mm, and the final polishing stage was\nperformed using a 1 mm diamond paste. The\nsynthetic CM was characterized by both Raman\nmicrospectroscopy and Raman area mode micro-\nspectroscopy directly on powder recovered from\nthe experiment. The sample powder was put on a\nglass slide, after a slight grinding by hand in an\nagathe mortar.\n2.2. Raman microspectroscopy\nRaman microspectroscopy was performed by\nusing a DILOR XY double subtractive spectro-\ngraph with premonochromator, equipped with\nconfocal optics before the spectrometer entrance,\nand a nitrogen-cooled SPECTRUM1 CCD detec-\ntor. A microscope is used to focus the excitation\nlaser beam (514.5 nm exciting line of a Spectra\nPhysics Ar\u0002/ laser) on the sample and to collect\nthe Raman signal in the backscattered direction.\nThe presence of the confocal pinhole before the\nspectrometer entrance ensures a sampling of a 1\u0001/3\nmm diameter area using the 50\u0003/objective, with a\nfinal laser power of about 1\u0001/4 mW at the sample\nsurface. Acquisition time was 20\u0001/300 s and 15\u0001/20\nspectra were recorded for each sample. Moreover,\nwe have analyzed \u0001/15\u0001/20 more points to obtain\nan insight into the sample structural heterogeneity\nby using the spectrometer live mode without\nrecording the spectra to save time.\n2.3. Raman area mode microspectroscopy\nFor strongly heterogeneous CM, the Raman\narea mode microspectroscopy was used. This new\nRaman technique is manufactured by JOBIN\nYVON and was initially dedicated to the study\nof photosensitive or thermosensitive samples. This\nO.

    "technique consists in a set of optics to introduce\nthe laser beam in an optical fiber, another set to\ncollimate in an appropriate way the beam emitted\nby the fiber before the entrance in the microscope,\nand an optimized optical system to introduce the\nbeam into the spectrograph. A microscope is used\nto focus the excitation laser beam (532 nm exciting\nline of a Nd-YAG laser) on the sample and to\ncollect the Raman signal in the backscattered\ndirection. It is then possible to obtain a beam\nwith an homogeneous repartition of power on a\nlarge surface. This surface is a function of both the\ndiameter of the optical fiber and the objective\nmagnification. In the configuration used in this\nstudy (fiber diameter of 100 mm and 50\u0003/ magni-\nfication), we analyzed a surface of 40 mm diameter\nwith a final laser power of about 1\u0001/5 mW on the\nsample. The spectrometer is a conventional JOBIN\nYVON LabRam. About five spectra were re-\ncorded for each sample and ten more were just\nanalyzed using the spectrometer live mode.\nBand position, band intensity (i.e. band height),\nband area (i.e. integrated area) and band width\n(i.e. full width at half maximum, FWHM) were\ndetermined using the computer program PEAKFIT\n3.0 (Jandel Scientific).\n3. Measuring the Raman spectrum of CM\n3.1. The Raman spectrum of CM\nRaman spectroscopy is used from the early\nseventies for the study of carbon materials. The\nRaman spectrum of CM can be divided in first-\nand second-order regions as illustrated by Fig. 1\n[15\u0001/17]. In the first-order region (1100\u0001/1800\ncm\u00041), the E2g vibration modes of graphite with\nD6h\n4 crystal symmetry are attributed to the vibra-\ntion of carbons within the polyaromatic structure.\nThe first one, E2g1 mode, is a shear mode and\ncorresponds to the relative vibration of the atoms\nperpendicularly to the aromatic layers. Because\ninteractions between atoms of different layers are\nvery weak (Van der Waals interactions), this mode\noccurs at very low frequency (\u0001/42 cm\u00041). How-\never, it is very difficult to separate practically this\nmode from the Rayleigh band and it is, therefore,\nrarely studied. The second mode, E2g2 mode,\ncorresponds to the stretching vibration in the\naromatic layers. Because the aromatic bond in-\nvolves very high energy, this mode occurs at an\nunusually high frequency (1580 cm\u00041). In practice,\nit is the studied mode and it is called the G band.\nIn perfect crystalline CM (graphite s.s.), there is\nonly the G band in the first order region (Fig. 1a).\nFor poorly organized CM or microcrystalline\ngraphite additional bands appear in the first-order\nregion around 1150, 1350, 1500 and 1620 cm\u00041\n(Fig. 1b). The 1150 cm\u00041 component appears only\nin very poorly organized CM, but its attribution is\nstill strongly debated. The 1350 cm\u00041 band (D1\nband), commonly called the defect band, is the\nmost important feature. This band is attributed to\na A1g mode, due to a change in the selection rules\nfor the Raman effect concerning some phonons\nbetween the K and M points of the Brillouin zone\n[15\u0001/18]. By comparing the thermal evolution of\ndifferent carbon materials using HRTEM and\nRaman spectroscopy, Be´ny-Bassez and Rouzaud\n[12] attributed (1) the D1 band to in-plane defects\nand heteroatoms and (2) the 1500 cm\u00041 band (D3\nband), present only as a very wide band in poorly\ncrystallized CM, to defects outside the plane of\naromatic layers like tetrahedral carbons. Lastly,\nthe 1620 cm\u00041 band (D2 band) makes a shoulder\non the G band, but its signification is not yet well\nunderstood. It is, however, important to underline\nthat (1) this band is always present when the D1\nband is present, and (2) its intensity decreases with\nincreasing degree of organization.\nThe second-order region (2200\u0001/3400 cm\u00041)\nshows several features about 2400, 2700, 2900\nand 3300 cm\u00041 (Fig. 1), attributed to overtone or\ncombination scattering [16\u0001/19]. The most impor-\ntant one, near 2700 cm\u00041 (S1 band), splits into\ntwo bands in well crystallized graphite. After\nLespade et al. [19], this splitting occurs when CM\nstructure acquires a triperiodic order.\nDifferent parameters are then useful to estimate\nthe CM degree of organization like the bands\nposition, bands FWHM, D1/G intensity ratio (R1\nratio), and D1/(G\u0002/D1\u0002/D2) area ratio (R2 ratio).\nO.

    "3.2. Some cautionary advices\nSeveral authors have raised the problem of\nanalytical mismatches when analyzing CM by\nRaman microspectroscopy [11,20,21]. Being opa-\nque material, CM is characterized by a high\nextinction coefficient of visible-light. Therefore,\nthe visible-light from the laser beam only excites\nRaman scattering in the uppermost several tens to\none hundred nm of the CM sample [19]. The first\nproblem is thus the sensitivity of CM to the sample\npreparation, because the structural organization of\nthis superficial part of CM can be affected by the\nthin section making, especially by the polishing\nstage. In order to avoid any mechanical disruption\nof CM, the best solution is to focus the laser on\nCM situated beneath the surface of a transparent\nadjacent grain [20], quartz or calcite mineral for\ninstance, as shown by Fig. 2 and illustrated by Fig.\n3. Such CM situated in the section thickness was,\ntherefore, not exposed during the thin section\nmaking.\nFig. 4 compares the degree of organization (R2\ncorresponding to the D1/(G\u0002/D1\u0002/D2) area ratio,\nsee discussion in the following) of several meta-\nmorphic CM measured at the surface of thin\nsection (i.e. polished CM) and beneath a transpar-\nent adjacent grain (i.e. unpolished CM), within the\nsame thin section. For poorly organized CM (R2\nhigher than 0.5), there is no significant difference\nbut it is difficult to conclude if polishing did really\nnot affect the CM structure, or if there is a strong\nFig. 1.

    "overlap with the pre-existing defects within CM.\nOn the contrary, in well organized CM (R2 lower\nthan 0.5) the spectra measured at the surface\nexhibit a higher contribution of the defect bands\n(D1 and D2). This indicates that the thin section\nmaking induced the formation of new defects.\nTherefore, in order to obtain homogeneous results,\nall measurements of CM using polished sections\nshould be performed beneath a transparent adja-\ncent grain. In case of experimental products,\ngrinding in an agathe mortar has no effect on\nCM structure as demonstrated by Salver-Disma et\nal. [22].\nAnother consequence of the opaque character of\nCM is the extreme sensitivity of CM to laser-\ninduced heating [23,24]. This laser-induced heating\ncan be easily detected as it is responsible for a\nshifting of the G band position downward to 1565\ncm\u00041. It is, therefore, necessary to use low laser\npower (B/5 mW). However, measuring CM within\nthe thin section thickness as described above\nallows using higher laser power because of the\nstrong\nheating\nremoval\nby\nthe\nsurrounding\nmineral matrix. The laser-induced heating can\nhave spectacular consequences in case of poorly\norganized CM which can be locally altered, as\nFig. 2. Comparison between the Raman spectrum of CM measured at the surface of the thin section (case 1) and the spectrum\nmeasured within the section thickness (case 2). Note the higher relative intensity of the defect band D1 in case (1).\nFig. 3. Photograph (optical microscopy, reﬂected light) show-\ning a grain of graphite within a calcite matrix. Two points of\nanalysis are represented at the surface of the thin section (i.e.\npolished CM, case 1 in Fig. 2) and beneath calcite (i.e.\nunpolished CM, case 2 in Fig. 2).\nO.

    "attested by the observation in reflected light of\ncrater corresponding to the laser impact at the\nsample surface.\nDue to a strong structural anisotropy, graphite\ndoes not exhibit the same Raman spectrum when\nthe measurement is performed parallel or perpen-\ndicularly to the c axis [21,25,26]. In the latter case,\nwhich corresponds to a measure in the graphite\nedge plane, the contribution of the defect bands is\nhigher. This problem of orientation can not be\neasily solved in case of powder samples. Meta-\nmorphic as experimental CM in this study has\ngenerally coherent domains with diameters lower\nthan a few microns [4,14]. As the grains size is at\nleast several tens of micrometers, if not hundreds,\nit is therefore, difficult to assume that the coherent\ndomains lie perpendicularly to the c axis on the\nglass slide, because they are randomly oriented\nwithin the powder grains. As discussed in the\nfollowing, this point constitutes a severe limit to\nthe characterization of CM powder using Raman\nmicrospectroscopy. In case of metamorphic CM, it\nis possible to avoid this problem of orientation by\nusing oriented thin sections, cut perpendicular to\nthe foliation. It is then possible to obtain an\noptical axis of the laser beam set perpendicular\nto the mean CM c axis [27].\n4. Deﬁning quantitative parameters from the\nRaman spectrum of CM\n4.1. How to obtain quantitative parameters from\nthe Raman spectrum of CM?\nThe problem is to obtain an accurate quantita-\ntive description of CM structure from its Raman\nspectrum. Such approach is common in the studies\nof\nmetamorphic\nCM\nwhere\nthis\nquantitative\ndegree of organization is used as an indicator of\nmetamorphic grade. Such quantitative parameters\nare obtained from the decomposition of the\nspectra by conventional fitting procedures. An\nexample of such decomposition is shown on Fig.\n1 for both the first- and second-order regions. The\noutput parameters are the band position, intensity,\nfull-width at half maximum (FWHM) and inte-\ngrated area. It is then possible to calculate\ndifferent ratio (R1, R2) with these parameters\ngiving information on the degree of organization.\nNevertheless, each parameter is sensitive to both\nanalytical and fitting procedures, these points\nbeing rarely discussed in the relevant literature.\nThe first problem is to define properly a base-\nline, which provides a reproducible result from one\nspectrum to another: the estimation of peak\nFig. 4. Comparison between the R2 ratio (D1/[G\u0002/D1\u0002/D2] area ratio) obtained within the same sample at the surface of the thin\nsection (i.e. polished CM) and measured within the section thickness (i.e. unpolished CM).\nO.

    "intensity (i.e. peak height) is, for instance, very\nsensitive to the choice of baseline. In order to\nreduce the contribution of baseline to the total\nerror of decomposition, the best solution is to take\nthe same baseline within a given sample set. In case\nof metamorphic CM, which is generally well\nordered, a linear baseline appears to be appro-\npriate (Fig. 1). A second problem is to choose the\nband profile for the spectrum decomposition. In\ncase of disordered CM, the Raman bands are\ngenerally a combination of Gaussian and Lorent-\nzian profiles. It is, therefore, necessary to select a\nfunction (1) combining the two profiles and (2)\nobviously, giving the best fitting results from\npoorly organized CM to graphite. For the typical\ndegree of organization of the samples here studied,\na Voigt function best fitted the spectra.\n4.2. What are the accurate parameters?\nFig. 5a presents the D1 versus G band positions\nfor all samples. About 90% of all spectra exhibit a\nD1 band position between 1345 and 1355 cm\u00041.\nThere is no significant evolution and the D1 band\nposition does not appear as a reliable parameter.\nMoreover, because of its dispersive character, the\nD1 band position strongly depends on the wave-\nlength of the incident laser beam [18,28], and thus\nall comparison concerning the D1 band position\nrequires to take into account this parameter. The\nG band position shows a larger range of values\nfrom 1575 up to 1607 cm\u00041 with the following\ndistribution: 1575\u0001/1578 cm\u00041 (\u0001/8%), 1578\u0001/1582\ncm\u00041 (\u0001/48%), 1582\u0001/1590 cm\u00041 (\u0001/29%), 1590\u0001/\n1607 cm\u00041 (\u0001/15%). It is difficult in very low\ngrade samples to separate the G band from the D2\nshoulder, and therefore, there is a strong incerti-\ntude on G position within such samples. However,\nthe real shift of the G band after the separation\ninto the G band s.s. and the D2 band can be\nestimated from about 1590\u0001/1595 cm\u00041 down to\n1580 cm\u00041. Nevertheless, the G band position can\nbe affected by laser-induced heating as discussed\nabove, and illustrated by the large number of\nsamples showing a value in the range 1575\u0001/1578\ncm\u00041 despite the technical precautions.\nFig. 5b presents the FWHM of D1 band versus\nthat of G band for all samples. About 70% of all\nspectra exhibit a D1 FWHM between 40 and 70\ncm\u00041. There is no significant trend and the D1\nFWHM, as the D1 position, does not appear as a\nreliable parameter. As the G band position, the G\nFWHM shows a larger range of values with the\nfollowing distribution: 15\u0001/35 cm\u00041 (\u0001/48%), 35\u0001/\n55 cm\u00041 (\u0001/31%), 55\u0001/75 cm\u00041 (\u0001/18%), \u0003/75\ncm\u00041 (3%).

    "appears as a potential parameter to estimate the\ndegree of organization of CM, however, with a\nlarge uncertainty: at a constant D1 FWHM, there\nis a large range of possible G FWHM.\nFig. 5c presents the R1 against R2 ratio. Both\nparameters exhibit a significant evolution from 0\nto 3.5 for R1, and from 0 to 0.8 for R2. In the\nrange 0\u0001/1 for R1 and 0\u0001/0.6 for R2, the evolution\nof both ratios is similar with a low dispersion of\npoints along the two axes. These two parameters\nare thus two reliable indicators of the degree of\norganization in such CM. However, it is important\nto underline that (1) the uncertainty is generally\nlower with R2 in comparison with R1, especially in\npoorly organized CM [4,5], and (2) in very poorly\norganized CM the R1 ratio can exhibit low values\nbecause of a D1 band very broad but not intense.\nAt higher values, R1 exhibits a significant evolu-\ntion up to 3.5 whereas R2 is more or less constant\nbetween 0.6 and 0.8. The latter parameter is not\nsensitive in such poorly organized CM whereas the\nformer is still sensitive to the variation of CM\ndegree of organization. However, in such poorly\norganized CM, it is difficult to define properly a\nbaseline, and therefore, the R1 ratios obtained\nfrom several spectra within a same sample can\nshow a large dispersion of values [5].\nThe R3 ratio corresponding to the S2/(S1\u0002/S2)\narea ratio was also introduced as a possible\nindicator. However, the range of evolution of R3\nis of less magnitude than that observed with R2,\nand makes R3 a less sensitive parameter [5].\n5. Characterization of structurally heterogeneous\ncarbons\n5.1. Nature of heterogeneity\nBoth natural and synthetic CM are structurally,\nmicrotexturally\nand\ntexturally\nheterogeneous\n[4,5,14]. In case of synthetic CM, recovered from\nHP-HT experiments using homogeneous starting\nmaterial, this heterogeneity is a consequence of the\ngraphitization process itself. Therefore, this het-\nerogeneity is an important parameter that must be\nconsidered when studying such materials, as it can\nprovide information on initiation and propagation\nof graphitization. The first problem is to separate\nwithout ambiguity the real (intrinsic) within-sam-\nple heterogeneity from some heterogeneity induced\nby the analytical procedure. The real within-\nsample heterogeneity can have various origins as\nheterogeneity within organic precursor or starting\nmaterial, anisotropy of stresses, heterogeneous\ninitiation of graphitization, for instance. On the\nother hand, the whole analytical procedure can\ninduce heterogeneity due to the measurement itself\n(orientation, laser-induced heating as discussed\nabove) or to the fitting procedure.\nCM are characterized by a multiscale organiza-\ntion, including the structure (organization at the\natomic scale within aromatic layers) and the\nmicrotexture (mutual organization in space of\nthe aromatic layers). Raman spectroscopy pro-\nvides information on the vibrational properties\nand is thus mainly sensitive to the CM structure.\nBoth natural and synthetic CM are structurally\nand microtexturally heterogeneous. However, in\ncase of natural samples, despite a large hetero-\ngeneity, the quantitative information obtained at\nthe mm scale of observation (Raman microspec-\ntroscopy) is significant and representative [5]. On\nthe contrary, the heterogeneity within synthetic\ncarbons\nis\nconsiderable,\nexcept\nin\nthe\n1-bar\nexperiment.\nThis\nheterogeneity\nincludes\nboth\nwithin-sample structural and textural heterogene-\nity as confirmed by HRTEM investigations, and\nanalytically-induced\nheterogeneity as discussed\nabove. It is, therefore, almost impossible to\nestimate an average degree of organization in\nsuch heterogeneous materials by using conven-\ntional Raman microspectroscopy, whatever the\nspectral parameter considered [14].\n5.2. Applicability of Raman area mode\nmicrospectroscopy\nThis technique is used to obtain a quantitative\ndegree of organization within strongly heteroge-\nneous carbons like the synthetic CM recovered\nfrom HP\u0001/HT experiments. Conventional Raman\nmacrospectroscopy, which provides a large laser\nbeam, suffers of several limitations as (1) the\nextremely long duration of measurement when\nO.

    "using CM because of the low laser power required\nwith these materials and (2) this method does not\nprovide an homogeneous repartition of laser\npower because of the difficulty to focus properly\non sample through a camera objective. The Ra-\nman area mode microspectroscopy presents sev-\neral advantages in comparison: short duration of\nacquisition (same magnitude than duration re-\nquired\nin\nconventional\nRaman\nmicrospectro-\nscopy), easiness for focussing properly the laser\nbeam at the sample surface by using a microscope,\nhomogeneous repartition of laser power at the\nsample surface and consequently large surfaces\nreally analyzed (more than two orders of magni-\ntude in comparison with conventional microspec-\ntroscopy). Lastly, it is important to underline\nthat such conditions cannot be obtained by just\ndefocusing the laser beam with conventional Ra-\nman microspectroscopy, because of the Gaussian\nrepartition of power within the laser beam. More-\nover it is not possible to analyze CM using Raman\nmicrospectroscopy and the mapping technique\nbecause this method requires to polish the sample.\nThis polishing stage is needed to focus homoge-\nneously the laser beam, but it can affect the CM\nstructure.\nFig. 6a presents three spectra obtained by Ra-\nman microspectroscopy within the same sample\n(anthracene based-coke at 1273 K, 2.0 GPa).\nThese spectra correspond to a large range of\norganization\nwithin\nthis\nsample\nfrom\npoorly\norganized CM up to well ordered CM. In the\nsame sample, Raman area mode microspectro-\nscopy gives a homogeneous type of spectra, similar\nto that represented on Fig. 6b. For this sample, the\nresults of spectra decomposition (R2 vs. R1) for 35\nspectra obtained randomly by conventional micro-\nspectroscopy and 7 obtained randomly by Raman\narea mode microspectroscopy are presented on\nFig. 7. There is a large dispersion for the former\nwhereas the latter exhibits homogeneous values for\nboth ratios. Moreover, the values obtained by the\ntwo methods are compatible as (1) they are on the\nsame general trend and (2) values obtained by\nRaman area mode microspectroscopy are in the\naverage of those obtained by microspectroscopy.\nFig. 6.

    "6. Conclusion\nRaman spectroscopy is certainly the most ap-\npropriate tool to obtain quantitative information\non disordered and heterogeneous CM, if a few\nprecautions are taken. Moreover, Raman spectro-\nscopy is complementary to HRTEM investigations\nfor such materials. Raman spectroscopy provides\nquantitative information on the structure that can\nbe difficult to obtain by HRTEM. HRTEM is\nactually the best method to image the sample\nmultiscale organization (structure and microtex-\nture), but these data are only semi-quantitative up\nto now.\nThe new method presented in this paper, Raman\narea mode microspectroscopy, is a powerful tech-\nnique to analyze disordered and heterogeneous\nCM. Such technique should also be very helpful in\ncase of photosensitive samples like carbon films.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks are due to Philippe Gillet (Laboratoire\ndes Sciences de la Terre, ENS Lyon) who provided\nus free access to the national Raman instrument.\nThis work was supported by the CNRS*/program\nMate´riaux (project 114) and by the INSU*/\nprogram Ge´omate´riaux.
