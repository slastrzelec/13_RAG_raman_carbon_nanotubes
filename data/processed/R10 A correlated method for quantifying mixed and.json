This method was developed for the intensity weight distribution analysis of mixed\nand dispersed carbon nanotube (CNT) mixtures. For Raman spectroscopy, mixtures of single-walled CNTs\n(SWNTs) and multi-walled CNTs (MWNTs) were prepared and dispersed on a coverslip. Mixtures were\nmade in the range from 1 to 100 mg (wt%) of SWNTs in 100 to 1 mg (wt%) of MWNTs. The ratios of the\nrelative intensities of the Raman bands corresponding to pure SWNTs and pure MWNTs were used for the\nconstruction of calibration curves used for quantitative analysis. The relative intensity of the deconvoluted\nspectral bands shows a characteristic feature at 1350 and 1592 cm−1 which was found to be proportional\nto the relative amounts of SWNTs and MWNTs in the mixtures. A correlation between the atomic force\nmicroscopy images and the tangential mode Raman intensity ratio was used without the need for other\nanalytical techniques. With this feature, it is possible to quantify the different components in the mixed,\ndispersed or unknown bulk of the CNTs investigated.

To explain, brieﬂy what\ndispersion means, raw nanotubes can create relatively stable\nsuspensions (spaghetti-like strands) at high concentrations\nof solvents, otherwise nanotubes still exist as bundles of\nvarying sizes, but separated individual nanotubes are not\npresent. This can be deﬁned as the macro-dispersion of\nnanotubes. In contrast, the individual dispersion can be\ndeﬁned.1–3 A common feature of CNTs (single-component\nor mixed samples) when dispersed is often the arrangement\nin various directions, their morphology and their different\ndensities on a coverslip surface or when embedded in\npolymers.4–6 The disordered structure may be related\nto the sequence of deposition of the various types of\nthe CNTs. Since the CNTs were discovered by Iijima,7\nRaman spectroscopy (RS) and other techniques have been\nemployed for their analysis.8–14 In a previous study, the\npotential of an ultra-narrow bandwidth laser as a light\nŁCorrespondence to: Han Athalin, CNRS, Institut des Mat´eriaux\nJean Rouxel, Universit´e de Nantes, 2 rue de la Houssini`ere, 44322\nNantes cedex 03, France.

RS is convenient for both the qualitative and\nquantitative analysis of multi-component mixtures without\ndegradation of the samples.16 RS has the advantage of\nusing a selected monochromatic laser beam which may be\nfocused precisely and selectively over any part of a solid\nsample, which may consist of different components. No\nsample pretreatment is needed and the local composition\nof the CNTs can be analyzed quantitatively so that the\nvarious components analyzed give Raman-active spectral\nbands. In this paper, we focus on the methodology of the\nquantitative analysis of mixed and dispersed CNTs used\nin our laboratory for analysis. RS is not very sensitive\nto the physical appearance of the sample, which means\nthat different phases (solid, liquid, gas) of samples can\nbe studied directly without preparation of the sample,\nbut it is sensitive to the conditions at the molecular\nlevel.\nATTRIBUTION OF THE D AND G BANDS\nThere are two predominant features in the Raman spectra of\nCNTs, the radial breathing mode (RBM) and the tangential\nCopyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

Pure SWNTs (physically different tubes)\nall exhibit an observable D-band signal with a weak intensity\nusually ¾100 times smaller than the G-band. The Raman\nspectra of the pure forms are in good agreement with those\npublished elsewhere.12–26\nmode (TM). The Raman wavenumbers of the RBM (ωRBM)\nbands appear between 120 and 250 cm\u00011 for single-walled\nCNTs (SWNTs) within 1 nm < dn < 2 nm and correspond to\nthe atomic vibration of the C atoms in the radial direction\n[Fig. 1(a)]. These features are very useful for characterizing\nnanotube diameters, dn.12,13,17 All carbon forms contribute to\nthe Raman spectra in the range from ¾1000 to ¾1700 cm\u00011.\nThe observation of the characteristic multi-peak features\naround ¾1580 cm\u00011 also provides a signature of CNTs,\ntypically giving rise to a two-band feature with two peaks\nnamed the D-band (or disorder band) around ¾1300 cm\u00011\nand G-band around 1590 cm\u00011 in the ﬁrst-order Raman\nspectra of CNTs [Fig. 1(a) and (b)].\nThe D-band in SWNTs is within the range ¾1285–\n1300 cm\u00011 having a full width half maximum (FWHM) of\n¾10–30 cm\u00011.18 For crystalline graphite-like allotropes (i.e.\nfullerenes) and glassy carbon (pure carbon produced by the\nthermal decomposition of polymer), the D-band is found at\n¾1305–1330 cm\u00011 and the FWHM is ¾30–60 cm\u00011.19 Multi-\nwalled CNTs (MWNTs) exhibit D-bands with parameters\nclose to those of the crystalline graphite-like allotropes.\nSecond, the peak denoted the G-band is around ¾1580 cm\u00011,\nhaving an FWHM of ¾5–30 cm\u00011.20,21 Generally, the doublet\nthat appears around ¾1553 and ¾1589 cm\u00011 can be attributed\nto a combination of the A1g, E1g and E2g vibrational modes, the\nwavenumbers of which are known to be weakly dependent\non the nanotube diameter. The G-band for MWNTs is a\nsingle peak at 1582 cm\u00011 and the FWHM is ≳70 cm\u00011.\nIn many cases, the G-band of MWNTs disappears with\nmixed samples,22 which is why in our study we used the\nD-band at 1350 cm\u00011 with a laser wavelength of 532 nm\nfor the analytical observation. The D-band usually creates\nambiguities as to whether it should be assigned to non-SWNT\nsamples or to defects on SWNTs. Even though calculations\nshowed that SWNTs also have a weak contribution in this\nregion, the D-band has been used for the estimation of sample\npurity.23,24\nThe two most intense G peaks of SWNTs are labeled\nGC at 1592 cm\u00011 assigned to semiconducting and 1587 cm\u00011\nassigned to metallic, for atomic displacements along the\ntube axis. The G\u0001\npeak at 1570 cm\u00011\nis assigned to\nsemiconducting and at 1550 cm\u00011 assigned to metallic, for\nmodes with atomic displacement along the circumferential\ndirection. The linewidths GC and G\u0001 for the G peaks from\nsemiconducting isolated SWNTs are usually ¾5–15 cm\u00011.\nFor semiconducting SWNTs in bundles, the linewidths\nare related to the diameter distribution. Otherwise, in\nmetallic SWNTs, the linewidth is minor for GC, whereas\nfor G\u0001 a signiﬁcant linewidth occurs, and it is found that\nthe linewidth for the Breit–Wigner–Fano (BWF) lineshape\n(broad and asymmetric peak) is strongly dependent on\nthe tube diameter. The origin of the BWF proﬁle is\nthe quantum interference between the zone-center optical\nphonon and continuum electronic transitions around the\nsame energy which can occur in the Raman signal of covalent\nsemiconductors. This requires a continuum of electronic\ntransitions, i.e. metallic SWNTs.23 The asymmetric BWF\nlineshape is given by\nI▷ω◁D I\n[1 C ▷ω \u0001 ωBWF◁/q]2\n1 C [▷ω \u0001 ωBWF◁/]2\n▷1◁\nwhere 1/q is a measure of the interaction of the phonon\nwith a continuum of states, ωWBF is the BWF frequency (ω)\nat maximum Raman intensity Iand is the broadening\nparameter. In order to analyze the Raman spectra quantita-\ntively, they were ﬁtted with Eqn (1) and a linear background\nusing a least-squares ﬁtting by a homemade subroutine in\nMathLab. For isolated tubes with dn > 2 nm, G\u0001 is similar\nto semiconducting SWNTs, and the band is ﬁtted using a\nLorentzian lineshape. Values of FWHM G\u0001≳70 cm\u00011 have\nbeen observed for isolated metallic SWNTs. Therefore, this\nbroadening is related to the presence of free electrons in\nnanotubes with metallic character.23,25 Selective RS can also\nbe used to distinguish between metallic and semiconducting\nSWNTs by their different G band lineshapes. The lineshape\nof this band depends on the excitation laser.13 Spectra in this\nwavenumber range can be used for the characterization of\nnanotubes and their degree of disorder and/or entanglement\ncan be extracted.\nOtherwise, the position with relative intensity of the\nRaman peaks varies with carbon allotropes.26 The intensity\nratio of the 1350 and 1592 cm\u00011 bands has been used to\nquantify mixed and dispersed nanotubes. The FWHM ratio\nbetween the D- and G-bands is assigned to I▷D/G◁\nand the relative intensity between the D- and G-bands\nis assigned to I ▷ID/IG◁27 derived by the authors from\nthe equation La D 43.5/RI, which has often been used\nto validate the crystallinity from x-ray diffraction,28,29\nwithout any other consideration. Generally, the correlation\nof quantitation was not clariﬁed but the authors concluded\nthat ‘by careful examination of the spectra, . . . and further\nCopyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nJ.

Here, we extended the analytical\nmethods used in RS experiments to allow reproducible, full\nquantitative/qualitative Raman spectra to be produced.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nSpatial resolution and instrument\nTo\nobtain\nreliable\nquantitative\nvalues\nfrom\na\nthree-\ndimensional (3D) microstructure, it is necessary to know the\nsample volume V from which the signal Iis collected. The\nresolving power of the microscopes used by the RS systems\nbased on classical focusing optics is restricted to certain lim-\nits. Two beams with wavelengths \u0006 and \u0006 C υ\u0006 are resolved\nif the maximum of the diffraction pattern for one beam coin-\ncides with the minimum of the diffraction pattern for the\nother beam. This is known as the diffraction limit: this dis-\ntance represents the diffraction-limited (DL) resolution of the\nmicroscope. For the lateral dimension, the Rayleigh length is\ngiven by υr D ▷0.61\u0006/N.A.◁, where \u0006 is the wavelength and\nN.A. is the numerical aperture, deﬁned by N.A. D \b sin ˛,\nwhere \b is the refractive index and ˛ is the half-aperture of\nthe imaging optics. According to a similar criterion, the axial\nresolution is given by υz D 2\b\u0006/▷N.A.◁2. The values υr and\nυz allow one to deﬁne a DL volume which corresponds to\nthe 3D resolution of the confocal microscope (CM). By using\na single-line Nd : YAG 532 nm laser (GCL-S from L.2000)\nwith a very narrow bandwidth (up to 0.001 nm), we could\nspectrally resolve each selected sampling area within the CM\ndetection volume. In this work, the laser wavelength 532 nm\nwas used for all measurements; in addition, a 633 nm single-\nline source (iPac from Toptica Photonics) was also used for\nveriﬁcation. In the CM-powered RS system of our setup, the\nspatial resolution achieved is about ¾\u0006 with a high-quality\nTEM00 laser to perform imaging without geometric aberra-\ntion with the dry objective. In this setup, a high-resolution\ncomputer-controlled piezo-motor (PIFOC P-720 from P.I.) is\nattached to the focus control and the focal plane of the objec-\ntive is systematically moved in discrete steps through the\nsample. A 60ð (N.A. 1.2) dry objective (UPLAPO 60ð from\nOlympus) was used both to focus the laser and to collect the\nscattered radiation in an epi-illumination conﬁguration.\nTo collect essential Raman spectra, the scattered light\nafter the CM is focused into the entrance slit of a holo-\ngraphic axial transmissive imaging spectrograph (Holospec\n5000R from Kaiser), which provides an extremely high\nthroughput.30 In addition, the laser residence time is min-\nimized, which prevents the sample from being burnt by\noverexposure to the laser. The aperture ratio of f/1.8 provides\na 5–20 times greater collection angle than spectrographs\noperating at f/8. This RS system was chosen for its high\nsensitivity and stability. The focus lens and the spectrome-\nter entrance slit are chosen so that the focal point is at the\nentrance slit of the spectrometer and the solid angle of the\nfocused beam is f-matched to the spectrometer system. In\nthis way, maximum collection efﬁciency and high-resolution\nspectroscopic information with an accuracy of ¾1 cm\u00011 for\nthe Raman peaks are simultaneously obtained. A SuperNotch\nPlus ﬁlter is positioned before the entrance slit, which atten-\nuates the Rayleigh scatter by over six orders of magnitude\nand allows the collection of data at Stokes shifts as low as\n50 cm\u00011 and the simultaneous collection of both Stokes and\nanti-Stokes data. The Raman spectra were collected using an\nadvanced thermoelectric (Peltier) cooled back-thinned inten-\nsiﬁed charge coupled device (ICCD) with a photon counting\ncapability (DH 734 from Andor) mounted on the exit port of\nthe spectrometer.\nRaman intensity calibration\nRaman spectral intensities are directly correlated with\nconcentration.16 This assumes that no other changes in the\nsystem and samples occur. For a quantitative analytical\nexperiment, the Raman spectrum Lof a sample, measured\non a spectrometer, depends on several parameters,31 which\ncan be divided into three classes:32 (i) laser excitation energy,\n(ii) sample volume and (iii) the totality of the light collection.\nTherefore, the optical setup for sampling and collection is\noptimized, then the inherent stability of the Raman signal\nintensity needs to be known for the experiments. In most\npublished work on RS, the intensity calibration is concerned\nwith the calibrating detector spectral response, rather than\nthe detecting signal intensity across the spectrum.33–35 Owing\nto the variety of RS setups, an external standard needs to\nbe used to characterize the likely error in a quantitative\nexperiment and calibrate the spectrometer. This is to allow\nspectra from different spectrometers to be compared, and\nthen compared with published results. This aspect is\nimportant for the present work. The spectrum measured\ncan be written as the result of the convolution product of\nthe Raman signal of the sample by the apparatus function\nof the spectrometer, the whole then being multiplied by the\ndetector response and expressed as\nLD Rd▷\tKI◁\n▷2◁\nwhere Iis the Raman intensity emitted by the sample, \t\nthe apparatus function of the spectrometer, Rd the detector\nresponse and K is the convolution product.\nIn this setup, the detector response was checked using an\nHg–Ar light source (from Oriel) which showed variations,\nbecause the quantum efﬁciency of the ICCD is never totally\nuniform over the entire back-thinned chip. Pixel-to-pixel\nvariations in quantum efﬁciency are typically 0.05%. Hence\nany intensity ﬂuctuations are likely to be due to the laser.\nTherefore, a sample of diamond mounted on a coverslip was\nused as the external standard with a strong and single peak\nat 1332 cm\u00011. The calibration procedure used here is to sum\nintensity kilocounts per second [I▷kcts s\u00011◁] scans, which are\ncollected several times and then averaged. This gives an\naverage over the time period where intensity ﬂuctuations\noccur.\nCopyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nJ. Raman Spectrosc. 2005; 36: 400–408\n",
    "Quantifying mixed and dispersed carbon nanotubes\n403\nIn order to use RS to monitor these variations, the relative\ncross-sections for Raman scattering from diamond and CNTs\nwere determined. The integrated intensities of the Raman\nspectra, recorded at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm,\nwere then used to determine the weight% (wt%) of CNTs in\norder to give an indication of the spectral efﬁciency factor\n(SEF). This SEF can be compared and used as an indication of\nthe optimum experimental parameters. Similar data using a\n633 nm laser were also obtained. A curve-ﬁtting sub-routine\nwas developed with an analytical software (MathLab) for\nthe Raman spectra in order to determine the ratio of the\nintegrated intensity of wavenumber \n D 1332 cm\u00011 diamond\nband (\nreference) with that of the total integrated intensity\n(Imax\nG\u0001band) of the CNT Raman spectrum. In the relative Raman\ncross-sections of CNT spectra we found that the diamond\ntotal integrated intensity with axes in the h100i direction\ndiffered by a factor of 233 for pure SWNTs and 195 for pure\nMWNTs during our experiments. Therefore, the diamond\ntotal integrated intensity is 233 times greater than CNTs\nglobally. It is then possible to determine an SEF for CNTs.\nThe SEF, E, for the Raman spectra excited by 532 nm laser\nradiation was calculated using the following equation:\nED\n\nreference\n\nreference C ▷Imax\nG\u0001band/233◁ð 100\n▷3◁\nThe correlation coefﬁcient was 100, which means that the\nSEF is coherent. In our experiments, the Raman spectra of the\npure forms are in good agreement with the equation used.\nThe SEF was compared with the experimental parameters\nfor each spectra. Using this procedure, a calibration should\nbe valid over each sampling. The Raman intensity of this\nsingle peak was measured from the baseline. Therefore,\nbaseline corrections were applied to all spectra to remove\nthe small ﬂuorescent/luminescent background. They were\nthen optimized using Eqn (2) as the highest signal.\nMixing and dispersing process of CNTs\nHighly puriﬁed CNTs (SWNTs part BU-203 and MWNTs\npart BU-201) were purchased from Bucky USA. In our\ninvestigations, the mixed and dispersed CNTs were used\nwithout further puriﬁcation, as shown in Fig. 1. The average\ndiameters of most of the SWNT and MWNTs were in the\nrange 0.8–1.4 and 5–17 nm, respectively, according to RS and\natomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations, as shown\nin Fig. 2.36–38 The MWNTs and SWNTs were dispersed\nseparately in toluene by high-energy sonication using an\nultrasonic wand dismembrator. The high-energy sonication\ntimes ranged from 5 to 40 min. The SWNT and MWNT\nsuspensions were subsequently mixed in a bath sonicator for\n30 min. Different types of binary mixtures were prepared:\nmixtures were made containing 1, 5, 20, 40, 65 and 100%\n(percent of total weight in mg) of SWNTs in MWNTs\n(100, 65, 40, 20, 5 and 1%) (measured by Scientech SA-80\nanalytical balance). The mixture was then cast into a scientiﬁc\ngrade coverslip and the toluene was allowed to evaporate\nFigure 2.

In addition to CNTs, the topographic image\nshows in some cases a large number of small circular features\nwith a height of ¾2–4 nm which are due to condensed water\nand removed by the laser excitation heating. Therefore, no\nRaman scattering signal is detected from humidity.\ncompletely.The purityandstructure ofthe dispersedmixture\nof the CNTs were investigated using a Raman spectrometer\nwith laser excitation wavelengths of 532 and 633 nm.

It is clear that with the increasing amount of SWNTs\nin the sample, the intensity of RBM and the G-band gradually\nincreases, whereas that of the D-band decreases.\nThe mixtures were conﬁrmed to be homogeneous by\nAFM, giving two-dimensional (2-D) images [Fig. 2(a)–(j)]\nand by obtaining a constant Raman spectrum at a variety\nof positions within them, but at a constant depth just on\nthe samples (by a piezo-controlled objective). Figure 3 shows\nthat the Raman spectra were measured from 80 to 2250 cm\u00011\nunder the same experimental conditions: laser power on\nthe sample 200 µW, exposure time 2 s, one accumulation.\nMoreover, the position of the optical system (ﬁlter angles,\nslit, CM) was ﬁxed for one selected excitation energy. For\nall the mixtures of CNTs, the sampling volume can be\ndeterminated from the DL volume of CM, as illustrated\nin section ‘Spatial resolution and instrument’. Each Raman\nspectrum was collected three times: (i) accruable Raman\nsignal, (ii) veriﬁcation and (iii) conﬁrmation; the selected\narea and the representative spectrum are a median of the\nmeasured spectra instead of their average. This procedure\nallows the elimination of dark signals and cosmic rays.

As a result, there is often a severe overlap\nof the majority of the spectral features for different forms\nCopyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nJ. Raman Spectrosc. 2005; 36: 400–408\n",
    "Quantifying mixed and dispersed carbon nanotubes\n405\nof the nanotubes, e.g. the G-band of MWNTs. The RS of\nthe mixed CNT samples is related to the characteristics and\nthe content of each CNTs component. Otherwise, the ID/IG\nvalue increases with increasing disorder and with decreas-\ning crystallite size for each CNT component. However, RS\nof the IMWNTs\nD\n/ISWNTs\nG\nvalue, independent of the wavelength\nof the laser, is used to resolve quantitatively the relation-\nship between the Raman scattering characteristics of the\nmixed samples. Sometimes, a complete resolution of the\nvibrational modes of a particular functional group sufﬁces\nto differentiate the nature of the sample and allows direct\nquantiﬁcation.\nThe overlap of spectral features results in a need for more\napproaches for quantiﬁcation. Of the spectroscopic methods\nwhich have been shown to be useful for quantitative analy-\nsis, RS is perhaps the most responsive to quantiﬁcation.39\nSince the nanotubes are dispersed in any medium like\na metallized surface for surface-enhanced Raman scatter-\ning (SERS) spectroscopy, the latter is also applicable for\nthe qualitative/quantitative analysis for nanotubes. The\nKubelka–Munk equation is used to describe quantitatively\nthe diffusely reﬂected radiation:40\nF▷R1◁D ▷1 \u0001 R1◁2\n2R1\nC 2.303ac\n\u000b\n▷5◁\nwhere F▷R1◁is the Kubelka–Munk function. The diffuse\nreﬂectance for inﬁnitely thick samples (R1) is given by\nthe reﬂectance of a sample of ﬁnite thickness (Rsample)\ndivided by the non-absorbing reference (Rreference), a is the\nmolar absorption coefﬁcient, c is the molar concentration\nof the analyte and \u000bis the scattering coefﬁcient. Scattering\ncoefﬁcients depend weakly on photon energy, but absorption\ncross-sections increase abruptly as electronic transitions\nbecome possible with increasing incident photon energy.\nClearly, for a linear relationship between intensity and\nconcentration to exist, the scattering coefﬁcient must be\nconstant. At low analyte concentrations, the scattering\ncoefﬁcient will depend on the non-absorbing dispersant,\nwhereas at higher concentrations, the linearity of RS analysis\nmay be limited by the analyte. In developing a quantitative\nmethod based on vibrational spectroscopy, measures must\nbe taken to ensure reproducibility. Unique spectral features\nmust be identiﬁed and calibration studies must be performed\non samples, described by Eqn (3), of known composition\nusing peak areas determined by the integration required.\nRaman response from mixed and dispersed CNTs\nA single particle irradiated by a laser beam emits a radiant\nﬂux, ,16 which can be expressed as\nD R C E C F C T C N\n▷6◁\nThe Raman scattering, R, is always accompanied by\nelastic scattering, E, and thermal radiation, T.

While the elastic scattering E occurs at a different\nwavelength than the Raman scattering and can therefore be\nﬁltered out with suitable devices, the other contributions\nusually cannot be separated from the Raman scattering\nand various smoothings with ﬁltering algorithms have also\nbeen widely applied to improve the analytical signals.15\nThe intensity of a Raman line depends on a number of\nfactors, including the incident laser power, the frequency\nof the scattered radiation, the absorptivity of the materials\ninvolved in the scattering and the response of the detection\nsystem.\nFor the mixtures, complete deconvolution of the analyzed\nbands was achieved by employing a commercial spectro-\nscopic package (OriginPro, Grams, PeakFit). Therefore, the\narea under the curve I▷◁of the separated bands was used for\nthe quantitative determination of the two forms in mixtures.\nThe measured I▷◁, which is analogous to the Beer–Lambert\nlaw,41 can be expressed as\nI▷◁D ϕ0kvCV\u000bA▷ω0, ωs, T, Ci◁\n▷7◁\nwhere ϕ0 is the radiant ﬂux density of the incident laser\nbeam, v is the wavenumber in cm\u00011, C is the concentration\nof the analyte, kv is the ratio between the most intense peak\nand the others (or itself) of the Raman spectrum in the\npure compound (or standard) and V the probed volume.\nThe scattering cross-section, \u000bA, depends on the frequency\nof the laser, ω0, the frequency of the scattered radiation,\nωs, and the temperature, T, of the sample.42 In general, the\nRaman scattering cross-section of a substance in a mixture\nof i substances is not independent of the composition of\nthe mixture but depends on the concentration, Ci, of each\nsubstance and considering that the normalized intensity of a\nRaman peak can be expressed as\nIv\nN D s\nkv\nC\n▷8◁\nwhere s is a proportionality coefﬁcient. By considering the\nnormalized intensity in Eqn (8), an expression for the Raman\nintensity of the single component is obtained when the\nRaman spectra in different concentrations can be written\nfrom the pure compound and can be expressed as\nIv\nD Imax\nx\n100\ns\nkv\nC\n▷9◁\nwhere Imax\nx\nis the intensity of the most intense peak in\nthe Raman spectrum for a given pure compound. In the\nexpressions, kv is allowed to change the slope value for each\npeak and, with these new values, the predicted curves for\nthe less intense peaks can be found. Meanwhile, the intensity\nis normalized, the value of s of the most intense peak may\nbe given from the analysis of the Raman spectrum for the\npure compound and two for the (same) pure compound\nCopyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nJ.

For this, it is considered that each data\npoint in the spectrum of the mixture presents an intensity\ngiven by the sum of the equivalent points in the compound\nspectra which have to be scaled according to their respective\nconcentration C.\nI▷◁depends on both numerous instrumental factors and\nthe sample, which explains the difﬁculty in determining\nabsolute intensities as we described. As the scattering\nintensity is proportional to the concentration of the scattering\nCNTs, it is possible to acquire quantitative information about\na mixture. To determine how the individual components\ncontribute to the Raman spectrum of a mixture, raw spectra\nof the nanotubes are required, as seen in Fig. 1. Any set\nof spectral data consists of a ﬁnite number of intensity\nvalues measured at discrete and equidistant wavenumbers.\nEach spectral data point contains a contribution from all\ncomponents in a mixture. It is assumed that there is a linear\nrelationship between Raman intensity and the molar density\nof a substance.\nTo solve for the individual contributions requires the\napplication of multiple linear regressions or principal\ncomponent analysis. Each data point in the spectrum of the\nmixture has an intensity given by the sum of the equivalent\ndata points in the component spectra which have been scaled\naccording to their respective concentrations. Rearranging\nEqn (7), it can be seen that for a particular component x, the\ninstrumental factors can be expressed in terms of measurable\nquantities:\nkxV D\nIx\n\nϕx\n0Cpure\nx\n▷10◁\nTherefore, it can be deduced for a mixture composed of the D-\nband represented by M for MWNTs and G-band represented\nby S for SWNTs that\nImix\n\nD Imix\nM C Imix\nS\nImix\n\nD\n\u0004ϕmix\n0\nϕM\n0\n\u0005 \u0004 Cmix\nM\nC\npure\nM\n\u0005\nϕ\npure\n0\nC\n\u0004ϕmix\n0\nϕS\n0\n\u0005 \u0004 Cmix\nS\nC\npure\nS\n\u0005\nI\npure\nS\n▷11◁\nwhere Cmix\nM\nand Cmix\nS\nare the concentrations of components\nM and S in the mixture. Provided that the spectra of the\npure components are recorded at the same laser power,\nthe dependence of the spectral intensity in the mixture on\nthe laser power is represented by a constant multiplicative\nfactor. Furthermore, when the laser power is kept constant\nthroughout (ϕmix\n0\nD ϕM\n0\nD ϕS\n0), as is the case for the\nexperiments reported here, the expression is reduced to\nImix\n\nD pMI\npure\nM\nC pSI\npure\nS\n▷12◁\nwhere pM and pS are the concentration proportions of M and\nS. These values represent the proportions of M and S in the\nmixture assuming that it is ideal. Therefore, as many studies\nshow, pure SWNTs have very small ID/IG values, assumed\nto be 0.01,43–45 as seen in Fig. 1(a) and if there are some\nimpurities in the selected components it means that SWNTs\nor MWNTs can also be determined by Eqn (11). Given that\nRaman scattering depends on the number of molecules,\nthen in a mixture with two components illuminated and\nviewed, the concentration proportion is the mole fraction.46\nTherefore,\npM D\nnM\nnM C nS\n▷13◁\nand\npS D\nnS\nnM C nS\n▷14◁\nwhere nM and nS are the number of moles of M and S,\nrespectively, in mixed product pM C pS D 1. The present\nspectral observation on the samples provides a useful tool\nfor the quantitative analysis of selected components in mixed\nand dispersed CNTs.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFor mixed and dispersed CNTs, the D- and G-bands were\nchosen for the analysis. In order to ﬁnd the proper coefﬁcients\nto be ascribed in Eqn (7), the analysis of the Raman intensities\nof the pure CNTs and mixture of CNTs at concentrations of\n1, 5, 20, 40, 65 and 100% (percent of total weight) was\ncarried out. The experimental data are presented in Fig. 3. It\nis clear that with increasing amount of SWNTs in MWNTs,\nthe intensity of RBM and the G-band gradually increases,\nwhereas that of the D-band decreases. It was found that\nthe baseline is decreased by the increment of SWNTs in\nMWNTs. The D- and G-bands of the mixed samples all shift\nto higher wavenumber by 18 cm\u00011 with increasing amount of\nSWNTs (Fig. 4). Therefore, a detailed analysis of the G-band\nof MWNTs entirely overlaps by a combination of Raman\nmodes when the content of SWNTs is ¾2–3 wt%, as seen\nin Fig. 5. It is proﬁle broad and asymmetric and it is well\ndescribed by a BWF component. This result indicates that\nthe Raman scattering characteristics of the mixed samples are\nrelated to the characteristics and the content of each carbon\ncomponent.\nThe experimental data for the two TM bands of the\nMWNTs and SWNTs were used as examples; they were\ncompared with the predicted data using the respective\nvalues, and good correspondence was found. Figure 6 shows\nthat, in the analyzed range of SWNTs content, the calculated\nIMWNTs\nD\n/ISWNTs\nG\nvalues of the samples are in agreement with\nthe measured data. The Raman spectrum for each of the\nmixtures was predicted by Eqn (11) and the concentrations\nof the compounds were found for comparison with the\nexperimental spectrum. In the results relating to the spectral\nregression of the CNTs in the mixture, we observe several\nimportant points:\nCopyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nJ.

The G-band\nof MWNTs (pure component G-band at 1580 cm\u00011) weakens\non adding an SWNT (pure component G-band at 1592 cm\u00011).\nThe G-band of MWNTs disappears when the content of\nSWNTs is ¾2–3 wt% and it was deconvoluted into a double\nband by a Lorentzian and Gaussian component.\nFigure 6.

It is possible with intensity-calibrated RS to distinguish\nclearly between the SWNTs (and also mostly semicon-\nducting or metallic) and MWNTs in the mixed and\ndispersed bulk area. The clearest difference is seen for\nthe D-bands for the MWNTs and G-bands for the SWNTs.\nThese bands are in a region characteristic of conjugated\nRaman wavenumbers of CNTs. However, this suggests\nthat a conjugated Raman wavenumber CNT in one sam-\npling area gives generally clear spectra in routine CNT\nexperiments. As a consequence, the interpretation of com-\nplex experimental Raman spectra in reliable and absolute\nterms is difﬁcult without references. Nevertheless, it rep-\nresents more or less some kind of random RS studies that\ndo not allow a real selection of a desired nanovolume\nmolecule. Therefore, it is also necessary to develop local\nprobe techniques.47\n2. The ratios of the relative intensities of the characteristic\npeaks of the two components present in a mixture\nof known composition (w/w), were found to depend\nlinearly on the inverse of the SWNT concentration. The\nrelationship can be expressed in a linear calibration curve.\n3. In a mixture, where the identiﬁcation of the most intense\npeaks is in some cases not possible owing to overlapping,48\nthe relation k▷\n◁allows us to consider any other peak of the\nRaman spectrum for quantitative analysis. In addition, we\nobserved that the slope value for the most intense peak\ntakes a value of almost one at high concentration (volume\npercentages).\n4. The lower limit of concentration studied in the present\nwork was 1% S in 100% M (w/w) and was conﬁrmed in\na deconvoluted G-band spectrum as seen in Fig. 5. This\nconcentration was limited by the difﬁculty in mixing the\ntwo CNT forms.\n5. An additional result of the present method is that it\nyields information on the degree of homogeneity in the\ndistribution of SWNTs and MWNTs over the sample.\n6. Finally, the correlation between the topographical image\nobtained from AFM and the TM parameters obtained\nfrom CM-powered RS analysis demonstrated that RS is a\nfast and better method than AFM image quantiﬁcation,\nusing relatively simple equipment, for obtaining and\nquantifying mixed and dispersed CNTs in matrices. This\nmethod also has the advantage of using large 3D sample\nvolumes rather than the essentially 2D non-spectroscopic\nimage used in the AFM surface topographical method.\nHowever, it needs a relatively long time (from many\nminutes to several hours).\nSome points of caution have to be kept in mind with a\nmethod such as that described here. The absolute intensity\nof the Raman signal is dependent on the size of the particles.\nThere has been confusion in the literature about the nature of\nthe relationship, but a different study shows Raman intensity\ngrowing with decreasing particle size. Hence when methods\nsuch as the present approach are used on production batches,\none must ensure that the variation in CNT size is limited,\nor at least that the variation in particle size is similar for\nthe different components in the mixture. Another point of\ncaution is the heating of the sample which can take place\neven with a 532 nm laser. Any heating effects were below\nthe limit of detection. We would like to comment that for\nmany practical applications of RS it is preferable to use an\ninstrument where an acceptable signal intensity is obtained\nwith a single accumulation with long integration times rather\nthan multiple accumulation with short integration times.\nThe above mathematical expressions were applied to\nthe analysis of mixtures of CNTs, for the quantitative\nanalysis of concentration and also for the analysis of\nactive compounds. Moreover, this method can be extended\nCopyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nJ. Raman Spectrosc. 2005; 36: 400–408\n",

We would expect that\nthe mathematical expressions could be applied to CNT\nmixtures and complemented for the quantitative analysis\nof such mixtures by intensity-calibrated RS, as we have\ndemonstrated in the section ‘Raman intensity calibration’.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn alternative mathematical model has been presented\nwhich was used to determine the concentration and quan-\ntiﬁcation of CNTs in a given mixture. The work clearly\ndemonstrates that RS can now be used to produce quantita-\ntive concentration spectra of very complex 3D structures on\nthe nanometric length scale. The conﬁrmation of the linearity\nof the Raman data and the good reproducibility and detec-\ntion limit and high correlation coefﬁcients for the regression\nequations render the suggested analytical Raman method\nsuitable for the rapid identiﬁcation and quantitative deter-\nmination of SWNTs and MWNTs in a dispersed mixture.\nMeanwhile, this methodology has been further developed so\nthat absolute concentrations can be measured and thus quan-\ntitative images shown by AFM of mixtures homogeneously\ndispersed on the analyzed surface.\nAcknowledgments\nH.A. gratefully acknowledges JN-Circle colleagues for their con-\ntinued encouragement of his research projects.
