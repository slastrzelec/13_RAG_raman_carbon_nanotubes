We present preliminary results of Raman scattering measurements of multiwall carbon \nnanotubes (MWCNT). The nanotubes have been carefully dissolved, separated and then \ncharacterized by AFM. The micro-Raman spectra of the objects are taken with 514,5nm wavelength \nexcitations and in the temperature range 4K - 400K. Basically the spectra are quite similar to the \nwell known single wall carbon nanotube spectra, with the exception of the absence of low frequency \nband. The major Raman bands, that are observed in single wall nanotubes are found in the spectra. \nIn particular the disorder effects are visible due to the pronounced D band at ~1350 cm-1. Metallic \nand semiconducting type of conductitivity is distinguished through an analysis of the G (LO) mode \nat ~1600 cm-1. We noticed new feature in these spectra at ~843 cm-1. Low energy radial breathing \nmode absence has been also explained. \nIntroduction \nThe rapid progress of interest in carbon nanotubes research shows that atomic force microscope \n(AFM) is also an excellent tools for single nanotube characterization and treatment. At the same \ntime it has been shown that Raman spectroscopy is also a sensitive method of carbon nanotube \ncharacterization. Due to the specific combination of strong van Hove singularities of the phonon \ndensity of states and Raman resonance effects it is possible to measure Raman scattering spectra of \na small bundle of carbon nanotubes or even of a single nanotube. Recent progress in understanding \nof the Raman spectra of relatively simple single wall carbon nanotubes [1] stimulate the further \nRaman studies of more complicated multiwall carbon nanotubes. The combination of these two \nmethods (Raman spectroscopy and AFM) of characterization of MWNT gives a new wider \napproach to the structure and quality characterization carbon nanotubes. \nExperiment and sample preparation \nThe nanotubes have been grown by catalytic (Ni:Ce) method and have been purified. The \nfunctionalization of the MWNT was performed as follows. First, a small amount of nanotubes \n(powder form) has been immersed in solvent. We have tested four different kinds of solvents \n(chloroform, dichloromethane, toluene, isopropanol, 1,2-dichloroethane), but dichloromethane gave \nthe best results. For preliminary separation of nanotubes we used solution (MWNT with solvent), \nwhich was exposed to ultrasonic agitation for a few hours. We have also used spin-coating method \nto place completely separated nanotubes on an appropriate surface. We tested simultaneously three \nsurfaces: HOPG (Highly Oriented Pyrolitic Graphite), Si and SiO2, and finally we have chosen the \nlatter one. We noticed here that interaction between SiO2 and MWNT is very significant, likely due \nto strong van der Walls forces. Adhesion of nanotubes is astonishingly strong which is an important \nfactor of the procedure of nanotubes separation. The idea of spin-coating method is quite simple. A \ndrop of the falls onto fast rotating surface (2500rpm) and is homogenously splashed on the surface. \nThe procedure gives an additional contribution to the separation of nanotubes.. The nanotubes were \ncharacterized with AFM (Fig. 1) in tapping mode (Nanoscope IIIa, Digital Instruments) and Raman \n",
    "2 \n Studies of multiwall carbon nanotubes using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy \n \n \nspectra was recorded using DILOR 800 XY spectrometer. The Raman experiments were performed \nin ambient conditions and in helium condition for low temperature measurements, in backscattering \nconfiguration. For laser excitation we used 514.5 nm (2.41eV) line from an Ar+. AFM experiments \nwere performed in ambient condition. For sample scanning we used silicon tips.  \n     \n \nFig. 1 Left part: AFM scan image (phase mode) of separated multiwall carbon nanotubes on SiO2 \nsurface; right part: 3D view (topography mode) on one of these nanotubes. Nanotubes are from \ncatalytic (Ni:Ce) method. There is Si (001) layer under the SiO2 250 nm layer. \n \nResults and discussion \n \nInterpretation of Raman spectra of SWNT has been provided by Rao et al. [2] and \nDersselhaus et al. [3]. Recently less known multiwalled nanotubes have been  studied extensively \nby Raman scattering [5, 6, 7]. The results have been compared with SWNT.  \n \nAll the Raman spectra shown in this paper were taken on the sample that contained \nrandomly oriented MWCNT with different concentration of nanotubes on the SiO2 surface. Two \ndifferent  concentrations of nanotubes have been examined, one with nanotube concentration of \napproximately a few hundreds per 1µm circle (diameter of the laser spot) and second, with the \nconcentration of few thousands nanotubes per 1µm spot. The Raman spectra are presented at Fig. 2. \nThe difference between concentration can be seen considering the peaks which come from Si \n(303cm-1, 521 cm-1, 963 cm-1). We noticed that carbon nanotubes are good light absorbent, so the \nsample with high concentration of nanotubes (Fig. 2a) have Si modes with lower intensity. \n \nRaman studies of multiwalled nanotubes with large diameter distribution showed quite \nstrong similarities to the well known SWNT modes [4]. In our Raman spectra three dominating \nfeatures are seen. At  Fig. 2: two sharp Raman peaks, namely G(graphite)-, D(disorder)-band are \nseen. Their second-order harmonic (the G’ band), explicitly appears at ~1580 cm-1, ~1360 cm-1 and \n~2700 cm-1, respectively. In addition, a small feature called G2 or D’ near 1610 cm-1 and others \ndistinguishable features like G+D band (~2930 cm-1) and a small peak at ~ 843 cm-1, were observed. \nOne important feature, a low energy radial  breathing mode at 248/dt cm-1, where dt is tube diameter \nusually observed in SWNT Raman spectra is not seen in our spectra. \nPosition and intensity of our Raman peaks are in good agreement with theoretical calculations for \nsingle walled nanotubes, which shows that the vibration structure of multiwalled is quite similar to \nthe single walled nanotubes [4]. \n \nThe tangential G-band (at ~1580 cm-1), which derived from the graphite-like in-plane mode, \nhere (Fig. 2) is split into several modes where these two are the most distinct: G1 (1577 cm-1) and \nG2 (1610 cm-1). This result was also observed in the other papers [2,8]. These bands are related to \nthe lattice vibration of all carbon materials with sp2 bonds. The shape of the G Raman peak gives \n",
    " \nSolid State Phenomena, volume 99 (265), 2004 \n3  \n \n \npossibility to distinguish between semiconducting or metallic nanotubes. Here, we think, the \nnanotubes are associated with semiconducting type of conductivity. In purified sample G band is \nnarrower than in not purified, so the spectra shows that our samples were well purified.  \n \n \n \nFig. 2 Raman spectra of a bundle of muliwalled carbon nanotubes with high concentration (a) and \nlow concentration (b). \n \n \n \nThe disorder-induced D-band and its second-order harmonic, the G’-band were observed in \nall our spectra. These two features both appear in the Raman spectra of semiconducting and metallic \ncarbon nanotubes. In the purified sample,  the D-band is  weaker [5], but it can be also connected \nwith intrinsic impurities (defects) of nanotubes. It means that these carbon nanotubes are not the \nsame quality, because in all spectra we observed the same intensity for the D-band. We also \nobserved intensity variation of the G’-band. AFM has been used here (Fig. 1) to check the sample if \nthe nanotubes are good quality, i.e. what is the arrangement of nanotubs on the surface; if the \nnanotubes have bends or are they straight. The arragement of nantobes can couse some structural \nchanges e.g. strain deformation, and these changes can be detect with Raman spectroscopy. \nAdditionaly with AFM we can detect some impurities on the sample, i.e. small amount of soot,  \namorphous carbon and catalist leftovers.  \nThere is the interesting small feature at 843 cm-1, which is associated with armchair (n=8 to \n11) single walled nanotubes [2]. All armchair nanotubes with this chirality are assigned as a \nsemiconducting type of nanotubes. That confirms the conclusion drew from the G-band. This \nfeature was not observed in other studies concerning Raman spectroscopy of multiwall nanotubes. \nIn all our spectra we didn’t find radial breathing mode peaks. The explanation of this \nbehavior can be made in two ways. First, when the nanotubes can consist of too many walls (>20) \nand second the inner wall diameter is too big (>2nm) [5], and consequently the low energy peaks are \ntoo weak to be observed. From AFM studies we estimate outer diameter of nanotubes between \n18nm and 40nm. Unfortunately from AFM we can say nothing about internal diameter. Only from \nRaman spectra we can estimate that internal tubes are bigger than 2 nm in diameter. \nTo reduce noise we performed low temperature Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3) but radial \nbreathing mode was still not visible. Besides there was not significant changes in spectra in \ntemperature range 4K - 400K. Only some insignificant shift of the major Raman peaks can be \nobserved as well as an anharmonic broadening of the peaks.         \n",
    "4 \n Studies of multiwall carbon nanotubes using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy \n \n \n \nFig. 3 Temperature dependence of Raman spectra of a bundle multiwalled carbon nanotubes. \nConclusion \nRaman spectroscopy and AFM are excellent method of characterization of electronic and \nstructural properties of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Our Raman experiments have been \nperformed on bundles of nanotubes and are in good agreement with existing literature results. There \nis also new feature in Raman spectra at 843 cm-1, which was not observed in other Raman spectra \nstudies but it was theoreticaly calculated. We developed a method of functonalization of nanotubes \nwhich probably allows to work also on a single nanotubes. By optymalization of functionalization \nparameters we think it is possible to obtain such good separation of nanotubes that we could work \nonly on one of them.  \nReference \n[1] Raman spectroscopy on isolated single wall carbon nanotubes M.
