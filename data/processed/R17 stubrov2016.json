    "NANO EXPRESS\nOpen Access\nManifestation of Structure of Electron\nBands in Double-Resonant Raman Spectra\nof Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes\nYurii Stubrov1*, Andrii Nikolenko1, Viktor Gubanov2 and Viktor Strelchuk1\nAbstract\nMicro-Raman spectra of single-walled carbon nanotubes in the range of two-phonon 2D bands are investigated in\ndetail. The fine structure of two-phonon 2D bands in the low-temperature Raman spectra of the mixture and individual\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes is considered as the reflection of structure of their π-electron zones. The\ndispersion behavior of 2D band fine structure components in the resonant Raman spectra of single-walled\ncarbon nanotube mixture is studied depending on the energy of excitating photons. The role of incoming\nand outgoing electron-phonon resonances in the formation of 2D band fine structure in Raman spectra of\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes is analyzed. The similarity of dispersion behavior of 2D phonon bands in\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes, one-layer graphene, and bulk graphite is discussed.\nKeywords: Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), Graphene, Resonance Raman spectroscopy, Double\nelectron-phonon resonance mechanism (DR), Van Hove singularities, Arc-discharge method, Trigonal warping\nBackground\nSingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) due to their\nunique physical and mechanical properties have been\nextremely investigated during the last two decades.\nHigh-strength, electric, and thermal conductivities and\nbiological applicability make them an attractive material\nfor nanotechnology and nanoelectronics, and medicine,\nas well as biosensors and biocatalyst [1]. All these prop-\nerties are strongly dependent on nanotube structure,\nnamely how the graphene sheet is twisted up to form\nthe nanotube. Therefore, characterization of SWCNT\nparameters (n, m—indices) is always been a priority.\nResonance Raman spectroscopy plays a great role in\nSWCNT characterization and gives valuable information\nabout their physical and mechanical characteristics.\nMoreover, it is a powerful tool for investigations of\nelectron and phonon excitations and defects in micro-\nstructure of all carbon-based materials [2, 3].\nThe first-order Raman spectra of such materials always\nshow two main features: the graphite-like G band\n(~1580 cm−1), caused by scattering on Brillouin zone\ncenter phonons, and D band (~1350 cm−1) whose exist-\nence is related with defect-induced resonant scattering\n[4]. The G bands in the Raman spectra of SWCNTs\nshow a doublet structure (split into G+ and G−compo-\nnents). The shape of the G−component is highly sensi-\ntive to whether the SWNT is metallic, where a broad\nstructure of the G−band appears, or semiconducting\n(single-component G−band) [5]. Besides G and D bands,\nanother prominent feature at ~100–400 cm−1, called the\nradial breathing mode (RBM), appears in the first-order\nRaman spectra of SWCNTs. The frequency position of\nthe RBM modes gives information about distribution of\nsingle-walled carbon nanotube diameters according to\nthe relation ωRBM (cm−1) = 204/dt (nm) + 27 (cm−1) [6].\nThen, taking into account the SWCNT diameter distri-\nbution and comparing the energy of Raman excitation\nwith that known from Kataura plot optical transition\nenergies Eii (i = 1, 2, 3, …), one can assign the chiral\nindices (n, m) of the particular nanotubes excited in the\nresonant Raman process.\nSecond-order Raman spectra of carbon-based materials,\nand particularly of single-layer graphene, are dominated\nby 2D band at ~2700 cm−1, caused by the existence of\n* Correspondence: chig-ua@rambler.ru\n1V.E.

    "double electron-phonon resonance (DR) mechanism. The\nphonons with wave vector q = 2k, where k is an electron\nwave vector, participate in electron-phonon scattering in\nDR process, thus making it possible to study the structure\nof electron bands from the analysis of resonance Raman\nspectra [7, 8].\nQuantum states of 2D graphite (graphene) in a\ncomplex way modifies, when transforming into 1D states\nof the nanotubes leading to appearance of van Hove\nsingularities (vHSs) in a density of electron states (DOS),\nwhich determine the electronic properties of SWCNTs.\nIt also results in modification of the selection rules for\nthe DR process [9, 10].\nThe present paper studies the dispersion of two-phonon\n2D bands in the Raman spectra of SWCNTs, measured at\nliquid nitrogen temperature. The structure of 2D phonon\nbands is analyzed in relation to the electron band\nstructure of SWCNTs, and possible resonant processes\nare discussed.\nMethods\nSamples\nSingle-walled carbon nanotubes used in this study were\nsynthesized by the arc-discharge method in a 600-mbar\nHe atmosphere with nickel and yttrium oxides as\ncatalysts. The diameter distribution of the investigated\ncarbon\nnanotube\nmixture\nwas\nestimated\nfrom\nthe\nexperimental frequencies of radial breathing modes\n(RBM) as dt = 1.51 ± 0.30 nm [11].\nRaman Measurements\nMicro-Raman spectra were measured in backscattering\ngeometry at room and liquid nitrogen (77 K) temperatures\nusing\ntriple\nRaman\nspectrometer\nT-64000\nHoriba\nJobin-Yvon, equipped with cooled CCD detector. Lines\nof Ar-Kr ion laser with wavelengths of 454.5, 457.9,\n476.5, 488.0, 496.5, 514.5, 520.8, 530.9, 568.2, and\n647 nm were used for excitation. Excited radiation was\nfocused on the sample surface with 50× optical object-\nive. The laser power on the sample surface was always\nkept below 1 mW, in order to obtain acceptable signal\nto noise ratio and to prevent laser heating effect.\nResults and Discussion\nFigure 1 shows the Raman spectra of one-layer graphene,\ntwo-layer graphene, bulk Bernal graphite with (ab)n-stack-\ning, individual SWCNT, and mixture of SWCNTs. In the\nRaman spectra of one-layer graphene besides allowed in\nthe first-order scattering processes of G band, which is\ncaused by twofold degenerated valence intra-layer vibra-\ntions of C-atoms, intensive single two-phonon 2D band is\nobserved [7]. This band is due to second-order processes\nfor phonons near the K-point [12]. The intensity relation\nof G and 2D bands (I2D/IG ≈5) and uniform contour of\n2D band are the typical features of single-layer graphene\n[7, 13]. The 2D band in the Raman spectra of two-layer\ngraphene consists of four components, which are well ap-\nproximated by four Lorentz contours [13]. These compo-\nnents are known to be related with the structure of\nelectron\nbands,\nwhich\nare\nrevealed\ndue\nto\ndouble\nelectron-phonon resonance [7]. The 2D band in the\nRaman spectrum of monocrystalline Bernal graphite\ncontains only two components, which also reflects the\nelectron band structure.\nAs it was mentioned above, 2D band in the Raman\nspectra of two-layer graphene consists of four components\nFig. 1 Raman spectra.

    "(p1–2, p1–1, p2–2, p2–1) (Fig. 1). The interlayer interaction\nin two-layer graphene leads to an increase of 2D line com-\nponent number as compared with one-layer graphene,\nwhich connects with Davydov splitting (DS) of electron\nstates of one-layer graphene. Thereby, π and π* electron\nbands of graphene monolayer divide into four, π1, π1*, π2,\nand π2*, bands in the case of graphene bilayer. Dispersion\nof electronic states near the K-point in such graphene has\nparabolic behavior instead of linear behavior of one-layer\ngraphene [14].\nTaking into account the anisotropy of optical absorption\n(emission), only electronic transitions π1⇌π\u0001\n1 and π2⇌π\u0001\n2\nare allowed in bulk graphite crystals.\nIn bilayer graphene, the anisotropy of optical transi-\ntions is less sufficient than for bulk crystalline graphite\nand transitions π2⇌π\u0001\n1 and π1⇌π\u0001\n2 become also allowed\n[15]. That is why the 2D Raman band consists of two\nand four distinct components in the case of bulk graph-\nite and two-layer graphene, respectively.\nRaman spectra of SWCNT mixture and insulated\nSWCNT are also shown in Fig. 1. The G band in the\nRaman spectrum of SWCNTs consists of two components\nG−(1565.6 cm−1) and G+ (1590.5 cm−1), which are the\ncomponents of a chiral doublet. The G+ band corresponds\nto valence vibrations of armchair nanotubes perpendicular\nto nanotube axis and the G−band to valence vibrations of\nzigzag nanotubes parallel to the nanotube axis [9].\nAs it can be seen from Fig. 1, the 2D band at 2700 cm−1\nin the Raman spectrum of isolated SWCNT consists of\ntwo components (p1, p2) and contains three components\n(p1, p2, p3) in the case of SWCNT mixture. These compo-\nnents are well-resolved and could be approximated by\nthree Lorentz contours. The position of the main p1 peak\ncorrelates with the position of 2D band of single-layer\ngraphene. The low-energy peak p2 is downshifted to\n~33 cm−1 with respect to the most intensive p1 peak, and\nthe position of p3 peak is upshifted to ~26 cm−1.\nIn order to figure out the nature of the observed struc-\nture in 2D Raman band of SWCNTs, we carried out the\nresonance low-temperature (77 K) Raman measure-\nments. Figure 2 shows the 2D band Raman spectra of\nSWCNT mixture measured at different excitation ener-\ngies. As it can be seen, each 2D band in Fig. 2 consists\nof three components, which can also be approximated\nby Lorenz contours. Figure 2 also shows the dispersion\nbehavior of the analyzed components as well as the\ndispersion of 2D band for single-layer graphene [8]. The\ndispersion of analyzed components appeared to be\nalmost linear with slight variations from the linear be-\nhavior. The position and slope of the most intensive p1\npeak almost coincide with the corresponding values for\n2D band of single-layer graphene. The slopes of p2 and\np3 peaks also appeared to be close to the dispersion of\nsingle-layer graphene 2D band, with average frequency\ndownshift for p2 peak about 36 cm−1 and the upshift for\np3 peak about 26 cm−1.\nThe splitting of 2D band in the Raman spectra of\nSWCNTs was observed earlier [5, 10, 16] and was ex-\nplained by the peculiarities of double electron-phonon\nresonance process providing different resonant condi-\ntions for resonances with different van Hove singularities\n(vHSs) of SWCNTs.\nFrom the analyses of frequency position of observed\nradial breathing modes (RBM) at used excitation ener-\ngies, we analyzed the diameter distribution of SWCNTs,\nwhich are excited in resonant Raman process [11]. Thus,\nin the considered resonance process, SWCNTs with di-\nameters in the range of 1.20–1.79 nm are excited. Taking\ninto account the diameter distribution of SWCNTs, the\nrange of used excitations and making the correlation\nwith the Kataura plot in ref. [9], it is possible to con-\nclude that in our case, only the resonant processes with\nsemiconducting E33, E44, and metallic E11 vHSs can be\nobserved. At energies near Eexc = 1.91 eV, mostly metallic\nSWCNTs are involved in resonant process, which is\nadditionally confirmed by the presence of broad G band\nregistered in the Raman spectra (not shown here) [17].\nFig. 2 2D Raman band of SWCNT mixture at different excitation\nenergies.

    "Figure 3 shows the examples of possible schemes of\nresonant processes within the double electron-phonon\nresonance with vHSs of different SWCNTs giving rise\nto observed features of SWCNTs 2D band [10]. Thus,\nthe most intensive p1 peak can be attributed to\nincoming resonance processes shown in Fig. 3a–c,\nwhich in fact is similar to the case of one-layer gra-\nphene. The high intensity of p1 peak is provided by\nall types of mentioned resonant processes giving rise\nto this feature. The nature of less intensive down-\nshifted p2 peak can be related to the processes of out-\nput resonances with vHSs (Fig. 3a, c). The upshifted\np3 peak also could be a sequence of outgoing reson-\nant conditions but considering the effect of trigonal\nwarping [5, 16].\nFrom the obtained dispersion behavior of SWCNT 2D\nband and taking into account the energy of 2D band,\nwhich in our case makes ~0.3 eV, the expected down-\nshift of p2 peak frequency position with respect to p1\npeak in the considered double-resonant process can be\nestimated as ~30 cm−1 [10], which is close to experi-\nmentally observed downshift for peak p2.\nThe similar dispersion of the most intensive p1 peak in\nthe Raman spectra of SWCNTs and single-layer graphene\n2D band, as well as almost linear dispersions of additional\np2 and p3 peaks, in our opinion, reflects the general nature\nof SWCNT electron bands, which originate from single-\nlayer graphene electron bands within the zone-folding\nprocedure, in such a way providing similar conditions for\ndouble electron-phonon resonances.\nFig. 3 Examples of possible energy schemes illustrating different types of resonances with van Hove singularities (vHSs) giving rise to 2D Raman band\nof SWCNTs. a Incoming and outgoing resonances with EM\n11 vHSs for armchair (11,11) nanotube at Eexc = 1.91 eV. b Incoming resonance with ES\n33 vHSs\nfor zigzag (20,0) nanotube at Eexc = 2.18 eV. c Both incoming and outgoing resonances corresponding with ES\n44 vHSs and ES\n33 vHSs for chiral (15,7)\nnanotube at Eexc = 2.41 eV.

    "Conclusions\nThe fine structure of 2D bands in the Raman spectra of the\nmixture of SWCNTs and individual SWCNT is explained\nas caused by the structure of their π-electron zones.\nThe most intensive p1 feature of 2D band in the\nRaman spectra of SWCNT mixture and individual\nSWCNT is shown to be related with incoming reson-\nance on SWCNT van Hove singularities, which provides\nthe dispersion behavior with the energy of exciting pho-\ntons similar to the 2D band of single-layer graphene.\nThe less intensive components of the 2D band (p2 and\np3) in our opinion are caused by additional resonant\nconditions\nincluding\nthe\noutgoing\nresonances\nand\ntrigonal warping effect.\nAbbreviations\nDOS: density of electron states; DR: double electron-phonon resonance;\nDS: Davydov splitting; RBM: radial breathing mode; SWCNTs: single-walled\ncarbon nanotubes; vHSs: van Hove singularities.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ Contributions\nYuS carried out the Raman measurements, analyzed the obtained spectra,\nand drafted the manuscript.
