    "Chirality-selective Raman scattering of the D mode in carbon nanotubes\nJ. Maultzsch, S. Reich, and C. Thomsen\nInstitut fu¨r Festko¨rperphysik, Technische Universita¨t Berlin, Hardenbergstrasse 36, 10623 Berlin, Germany\n~Received 16 June 2001; published 11 September 2001!\nWe show that D-mode Raman scattering in single-walled carbon nanotubes is due to a double-resonant\nRaman process. The unusual shift of the D-mode frequency with excitation energy is even expected for a single\nnanotube. The magnitude of the shift and the D-mode frequency depend strongly on the tube’s diameter and\nchirality. Only tubes with (n12n2)/3n integer contribute to the D-mode spectrum because of the particular\nelectronic structure of carbon nanotubes.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.64.121407\nPACS number~s!: 78.30.2j, 63.22.1m, 78.30.Na, 71.20.Tx\nThe Raman spectra of carbon nanotubes have been widely\nstudied in ﬁrst and second-order scattering. The observed\nﬁrst-order Raman modes are usually divided into low-energy\nmodes\nat\n'200 cm21\nand\nhigh-energy\nmodes\nat\n'1600 cm21 ~so-called G mode!. Similar to graphite, the\nRaman spectra exhibit an additional peak around 1350 cm21,\nwhich cannot be attributed to a Raman-active G-point vibra-\ntion. It has been known for long that this so-called D mode in\ngraphite is disorder induced and corresponds to an optical\nphonon near the K point of the Brillouin zone.1,2 Additionally\nand for a long time a mystery, in both materials the fre-\nquency of the D mode depends on excitation energy.3,4 Fre-\nquency shifts of the D mode in carbon nanotubes of 38\ncm21/eV, 53 cm21/eV for single-walled and 43 cm21/eV\nfor multi-walled tubes have been reported.5,6,4 The same\nholds for the second-order peak D* ~sometimes referred to\nas G8), which occurs at twice the frequency of the D mode\nand shifts by about twice the rate with excitation energy.\nRecently, the excitation-energy dependence of the D mode in\ngraphite has been explained successfully as due to defect-\ninduced, double-resonant Raman scattering.7 Because of\ntheir related electronic structure the question arises whether a\nsimilar mechanism is present in carbon nanotubes as well.\nIn this paper we apply the double-resonance model to\ncarbon nanotubes. Although the origin of the D mode is es-\nsentially the same as in graphite, we ﬁnd that the one-\ndimensional electronic band structure in nanotubes strongly\nalters the double-resonance condition. Only in tubes with a\nparticular condition for (n1 ,n2) we ﬁnd the D mode, which\nagrees with recent experimental ﬁndings. Moreover, we pro-\npose that the D mode of single tubes, in general, consists of\ntwo peaks, their separation depending on excitation energy.\nCarbon nanotubes are classiﬁed into metallic tubes if\n(n12n2)/3 is integer and semiconducting tubes otherwise,\nwhere n1 and n2 are the components of the chiral vector.\nIndeed the electronic density of states in ﬁrst-order approxi-\nmation is the same for all metallic and all semiconducting\ntubes and depends only on diameter.8 The details of the elec-\ntronic band structure, though, in particular, the wave vectors\nkS at which the singularities in the density of states appear,\ndepend on a stronger condition for n1 and n2. In all semi-\nconducting tubes the singularities for optical transitions in\nthe range of visible light are at the G point of the Brillouin\nzone, i.e., kS50. Also in some metallic tubes kS is at the G\npoint, as in metallic zigzag tubes (n1/3 integer and n250).\nIn general, kS50 for all tubes with (n12n2)/3n not being an\ninteger (R51), where n is the greatest common divisor of\nn1 ,n2. For tubes with integer (n12n2)/3n (R53), the sin-\ngularities in the density of states occur near 2p/3a. All arm-\nchair tubes belong to this category; they additionally exhibit\na crossing of valence and conduction bands at the Fermi\nwave vector kF52p/3a.9\nFor the calculation of a double-resonant Raman process\nthe usual assumption that resonances are governed by the\njoint density of electronic states is no longer valid. Instead\nthe full electronic dispersion has to be considered. We will\nshow that the classiﬁcation into R53 and R51 divides the\ntubes into those where one expects and does not expect the D\nmode, respectively. We start our investigation by considering\narmchair tubes, which are most familiar from the literature.\nAfter that we extend our model to general chiral tubes.\nIn armchair tubes optical transitions between the valence\nand conduction band in the range of visible light occur near\nkF52p/3a. Optical transitions between the bands which\ncross at kF52p/3a are forbidden by selection rules. A\ndefect-induced Raman process with two resonant transitions\nis then possible as shown in Fig. 1. The incoming photon\nresonantly excites an electron-hole pair near kF ~1!, and the\nelectron is resonantly scattered by a phonon across the\nG-point to '2kF ~2!. The electron is scattered back elasti-\ncally by a defect to a virtual state ~3!, and the electron-hole\npair recombines Eq. ~4!. For a given incoming resonance\nonly a unique combination of phonon energy \\vph and pho-\nnon wave vector q fulﬁlls the double-resonance condition.\nThe phonon wave vector q involved in the above process is\nuqu'2kF54p/3a5:q0. In zone folding this corresponds to\na phonon mode originating from the K point of graphite and\nhence yields a phonon energy in the range of the D mode. If\nthe excitation energy is increased, the incoming ~or, alterna-\ntively, outgoing! resonance occurs at a greater distance from\nkF . Therefore, the phonon wave vector leading to the second\nresonant transition becomes smaller or larger, depending on\nwhich side of the minimum the electron-hole pair was ex-\ncited, see Fig. 1. As there is a minimum in the optical phonon\ndispersion at q054p/3a, the phonon energy increases if the\nphonon wave vector moves away from q0.\nWe calculate the Raman cross section for defect-induced\nscattering, which is given by fourth-order time-dependent\nperturbation theory:10\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B, VOLUME 64, 121407~R!\n0163-1829/2001/64~12!/121407~4!/$20.00\n©2001 The American Physical Society\n64 121407-1\n",

We assume the matrix elements M\nto be constant, but include the selection rules for optical\nabsorption and electron-phonon coupling. The sum in Eq. ~1!\nis taken over all possible intermediate states and bands m,\nwhere the band index m corresponds to the discrete states k'\nperpendicular to the tube axis originating from the periodic-\nity along the cirumference of the tube. For the electronic\ndispersion we use the symmetry-based tight-binding approxi-\nmation with an overlap integral g052.9 eV.11 We choose\nthe incoming and outgoing light as polarized parallel to the\ntube axis ~z! since this conﬁguration was found to contribute\nmost of the Raman signal in single-walled nanotubes.12–14\nFor other scattering geometries our results do not change\nfundamentally. The Dm selection rule for z-polarized optical\ntransitions is Dm50,15 and the electron can only be scat-\ntered by a phonon within the same band. Therefore only\nphonons with band index m50 (A1g symmetry at the\nG-point! are allowed. If the phonon wave vector q.p/a, the\nband m50 changes into m5n, because m is not conserved\nat the zone boundary.16 This is depicted for the optical-\nphonon dispersion in armchair tubes in Fig. 1 ~bottom!; only\nthe bands m50,n are shown. The armchair m5n band cor-\nresponds to the graphite phonons in the G2K2M direction\nwith qP]p/a,2p/a] and thus contains the K point of graph-\nite. For the phonon dispersion we use a model dispersion\nadapted to experimental and calculated values of the G and\nK-point frequencies,17 which additionally reﬂects the sym-\nmetry of the hexagonal Brillouin zone of graphene.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the Raman spectra calculated with Eq.\n~1! for an ~11,11! tube at three different excitation energies.\nThe full calculated spectrum is displayed in the inset. We\nﬁnd a peak in the frequency range of the D mode, which is\nclearly dependent on the laser energy. Evidently our calcula-\ntions reproduce the experimentally observed D mode. The\ncalculated D mode is not symmetric and actually consists of\ntwo close together peaks. Their separation depends on the\nexcitation energy; the smaller peak which appears as a shoul-\nder on the low-frequency side shifts with excitation energy\nacross the main peak. There are three reasons for this double-\npeak structure: the minimum of the electronic bands is\nshifted from kF52p/3a, both the electron and phonon dis-\npersion are not exactly symmetric around the minimum, and\nincoming and outgoing resonance yield a slightly different\nD-mode energy. The ﬁrst two reasons account for the asym-\nmetry of the peaks and their separation depending on excita-\ntion energy. Incoming and outgoing resonances are not re-\nsolved in our calculated spectra, but become visible when the\ndispersions are modiﬁed to be symmetric around the minima.\nIn Fig. 3 ~top! the calculated frequency of the D mode is\nshown for a ~10,10! and an ~8,8! tube as a function of exci-\ntation energy. The frequency shifts of the D mode are 42\ncm21/eV for the main peak and 76 cm21/eV for the low-\nFIG. 1.

For comparison we\nshow in Fig. 3 ~bottom! the experimentally obtained D-mode\nshift of unoriented single-walled nanotubes with a mean di-\nameter of 1.3 nm.18 In the inset the D mode at a laser energy\nof 2.66 eV is shown. Similar to our calculations, the D mode\nconsists of a main peak with a shoulder on the low-energy\nside. The shifts of the two peaks are 47 cm21/eV and 63\ncm21/eV. The calculated slope of the energy shift as well as\nthe double-peak structure are in excellent agreement with the\nexperiments.\nIn our calculations, the energy shift of the main peak in-\ncreases with decreasing tube diameter whereas the absolute\nenergies decrease. This is easily understood from the double-\nresonance process in Fig. 1. For smaller diameters the energy\nseparation between valence and conduction band is larger.\nTherefore, at a given excitation energy a resonant transition\noccurs closer to the conduction-band minimum. First, this\nrequires a phonon wave vector closer to q0 for the second\nresonant transition which leads to a smaller phonon energy.\nSecond, the slope of the electron dispersion is smaller near\nthe conduction-band minimum. The wave vector of the ini-\ntial state as well as the phonon wave vector in the resonance\nprocess depend stronger on excitation energy than for a\nlarger slope in the electron dispersion. The same effect oc-\ncurs if the overlap integral g0 is varied; with decreasing g0\nthe excitation-energy dependence of the D mode increases,\nbut the absolute frequencies of the D mode are smaller.\nThe calculations discussed so far are for Stokes scattering.\nIn anti-Stokes scattering we ﬁnd the D-mode frequencies to\nbe by '13 cm21 higher than in the Stokes spectra. Again\nthis up-shift follows from the double resonance. At a given\nexcitation energy the phonon required for the second reso-\nnant transition is at a greater distance from q0 than in Stokes\nscattering and therefore has a higher frequency. Experimen-\ntally, the difference between Stokes and anti-Stokes frequen-\ncies has been observed in graphite and is also expected for\ncarbon nanotubes.19 The second-order mode D* is contained\nin the double-resonance model as well. The condition for the\ndouble resonance does not change in second order with re-\nspect to ﬁrst order. Instead of defect scattering the excited\nelectron ~Fig. 1! is scattered twice by phonons with same\nenergy but opposite wave vector and with a much larger\nRaman signal, because it is a Raman-allowed process. This\nleads to the D* mode in second-order spectra at twice the\nfrequency of the ﬁrst-order D mode. Consequently, the fre-\nquency shift of the D* mode as a function of excitation\nenergy\nis\ntwice\nthe\nﬁrst-order\nshift,\nas\nobserved\nexperimentally.4,5\nWe now turn to the discussion of general tubes. For the\npresence of the D mode and its excitation-energy dependence\nit is essential that the minima of both the electron and\noptical-phonon dispersion are around 2/3 of the Brillouin\nzone as in armchair tubes. The electron wave vector ki at\nwhich the resonant optical transition occurs and the phonon\nwave vector associated with the D-mode frequency both\noriginate from the same part of the graphite Brillouin zone.\nThe double-resonance process, on the other hand, involves a\nphonon wave vector q'22ki , see Fig. 1. The condition for\ndouble-resonant D-mode scattering is thus q'22ki5ki\n62p/a, which directly yields ki52p/3a for the wave vec-\ntor of the electronic transitions. As discussed in the begin-\nning, only if R53 the resonant optical transitions occur\nclose to 2p/3a. Therefore, we expect the D mode only for\ntubes with R53. This is not a selection rule in the sense that\nscattering in R51 tubes was forbidden by symmetry; but in\nR51 tubes the double-resonance condition cannot be ful-\nﬁlled by phonons with the D-mode frequency and wave vec-\ntors. Experimentally, a peak originating from a high phonon\ndensity of states might still be observed. It should, however,\nbe weak in intensity and not show the excitation-energy de-\npendence.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the calculated D-mode spectrum of the\n~8,2! tube (R53) for three different excitation energies.

    "ﬁnd again a double-peak structure in the D-mode frequency\nrange which shifts by 40 cm21/eV ~main peak! and 27\ncm21/eV ~small peak on the low-energy side! with increas-\ning excitation energy.\nIn zigzag tubes (R51) the conduction-band minima are\neither at the G point or at the zone boundary; we do not\nexpect the D mode at all. Moreover, in zigzag tubes the m\n50 phonon band is above the frequency range of the D\nmode. Nevertheless, even if we modiﬁed the phonon fre-\nquencies with respect to graphite or included the E1g ,E2g\n(m51,2) phonon bands for other scattering conﬁgurations,\nwe neither obtained the D mode nor the excitation-energy\ndependence by evaluating Eq. ~1!.\nIn the preceeding discussion we showed that only tubes\nwith R53 contribute to the D mode in ﬁrst-order Raman\nspectra. The fact that particular single tubes do not show the\nD mode at all has been conﬁrmed in ﬁrst experiments on\nisolated single-walled nanotubes.20 Raman spectra recorded\nfrom other single tubes in contrast exhibit a D mode which\nhas nearly the same intensity as the high-energy G mode.12\nAnother experimental ﬁnding is qualitatively explained by\nour calculations. Gru¨neis et al.6 reported that the shift of the\nD mode in carbon nanotubes is not fully linear but superim-\nposed by a sine-like function. The excitation-energy depen-\ndence of the D mode in our model is only linear if both\ndispersions are linear as well. A small deviation from the\nlinearity is caused by the modiﬁed electron and phonon dis-\npersion in nanotubes with respect to graphite. To study this\nbehavior theoretically we need to include the modiﬁed pho-\nnon dispersion for speciﬁc carbon nanotubes and its depen-\ndence on the nanotube diameter, which will be done in a\nfuture work.\nIn conclusion, we showed that the D mode in the ﬁrst-\norder Raman spectra of carbon nanotubes is due to a defect-\ninduced, double-resonant Raman process. In our model the\nexcitation-energy dependence of the D mode is a property of\nan individual tube. We calculated shifts of the D mode as a\nfunction of excitation energy between 35 and 56 cm21/eV\ndepending on tube diameter and chirality, which agrees well\nwith experimental data. The D mode of nanotubes exhibits a\ndouble-peak structure with the low-energy secondary peak\nshifting at a rate different from the main peak, which is\nfound experimentally as well. The second-order mode D*\nand the difference in Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering follow\nfrom the double-resonance model. Finally, we showed that\nall armchair tubes, most of the metallic chiral tubes ~namely,\nthose with R53), and none of the zigzag or semiconducting\nchiral tubes show double-resonant D-mode scattering. There-\nfore, a single tube, which exhibits a strong D mode in the\nRaman spectra, can be identiﬁed as metallic.\nThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsge-\nmeinschaft under Grant No. Th 662/8-1.\n1F.
