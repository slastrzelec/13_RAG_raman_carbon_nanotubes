    "Characterization of Phases Formed in the Iron Carbide\nProcess by X-Ray Diffraction, Mossbauer, X-Ray\nPhotoelectron Spectroscopy, and Raman Spectroscopy\nAnalyses\nEUNGYEUL PARK, JIANQIANG ZHANG, STUART THOMSON, OLEG OSTROVSKI, and\nRUSSELL HOWE\nIron carbide was prepared by iron ore reduction and iron cementation using Ar-H2-CH4 gas mixture\nwith and without sulfur. Phases formed in the reduction/cementation process were examined by X-\nray diffraction (XRD), Mossbauer, and Raman spectroscopy. The sample surface was also analyzed\nby X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD and Mossbauer analyses showed that iron oxide\nwas first reduced to metallic iron, and then, metallic iron was carburized to cementite. Addition of\na small amount of H2S to the reaction gas retarded the cementite formation but made the cementite\nmore stable. XPS analysis showed that the surface of samples converted to iron carbide using sulfur-\ncontaining gas consisted of mainly Fe3C and a small amount of graphitic carbon. Raman spectra of\na sample produced in the iron carbide process showed the G and D bands, which are characteristic\nfor carbon-carbon bonds. The intensity ratio of G/D bands depended on the sulfur content in the\nreducing/carburizing gas.\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\n3Fe2O3(s) 1 5H2(g) 1 2CH4(g) 5 2Fe3C(s) 1 9H2O(g)\nTHE iron carbide process has been developed as an\n[1]\nalternative ironmaking process, in which iron ore fines are\nIn the iron carbide process, hematite is first quickly\nreduced by hydrogen-methane gas mixture in a fluidized bed\nreduced by hydrogen to magnetite, and then, magnetite is\nreactor at relatively low temperature.[1–8] The iron carbide\nreduced further to metallic iron when the temperature is\nprocess has some advantages over the conventional blast\nbelow 568 8C.

The scanning speed and step size were 0.6 deg/min\nand 0.01 deg, respectively.\nC.

The\ntransmission of g-rays through the absorber was detected\nusing a Krypton-filled proportional detector. The resulting\nMossbauer spectrum was accumulated by a multichannel\nanalyzer, with 512 channels, and stored in the computer\nsystem for subsequent analysis. All isomer shifts were\nquoted relative to the center of the a-Fe calibration spectrum.\nThe experimental 57Fe Mossbauer spectra were fitted by a\nleast-squares fitting procedure using the 57Fe Mossbauer\nfitting program.\nD.

    "completed in about 15 minutes. In all reduced/carburized\nsamples, two strong peaks were observed at ,1350 and\n,1600 cm21. This doublet is attributed to the so-called D\nband and the G band of graphite.[15,20–24] Also, two overtones\nand one combination of D and G bands were found at ,2700,\n,3200, and ,2950 cm21. The D band occurs at around\n1350 cm21 in amorphous sp22 bonded carbon species, such\nas pyrolytic graphite, glassy carbon, and carbon powder. In\ncrystalline graphite, only the G band is observed at around\n1600 cm21. Therefore, the intensity of the D band grows\nwith decreasing fraction of graphite. The Raman data show\nthat carbon deposition on a sample surface started before\n(a)\nthe completion of the reduction process. However, when the\nreduction was completed, the amount of deposited carbon\non a sample surface increased rapidly with the reaction time.\nThis is agreement with results from carbon analysis (Fig-\nure 4).\nIn the process of iron oxide reduction and iron cementa-\ntion, carbon on the surface of metallic iron, formed as a\nresult of methane cracking, diffuses to a sample interior\nforming iron carbide. Cementite formed on the sample sur-\nface acts as a barrier to the carbon diffusion because the\ndiffusion coefficient of carbon in iron carbide is much\nsmaller than in pure iron.[25] This causes carbon accumula-\ntion on the surface and, eventually, cementite decomposi-\ntion.[9]\nThe proportions of carbon in the amorphous and graphitic\nforms can be estimated from the intensity ratio of D to G\nbands. The D/G intensity ratio is above one for a Nucor\nsample (Figure 8) and a sample reduced by sulfur-containing\ngas (Figure 10). This means that carbon in these samples\n(b)\npredominantly exists in the amorphous phase.
