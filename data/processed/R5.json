    "Raman and IR Spectroscopy of Chemically Processed\nSingle-Walled Carbon Nanotubes\nUn Jeong Kim,† Clascidia A. Furtado,‡ Xiaoming Liu,† Gugang Chen,† and\nPeter C. Eklund*,†,§\nContribution from the Departments of Physics and Materials Science, The PennsylVania State\nUniVersity, UniVersity Park, PennsylVania 16802, and Centro de DesenVolVimento da\nTecnologia Nuclear, CDTN/CNEN, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil\nReceived May 5, 2005; E-mail: pce3@psu.edu\nAbstract: IR and Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the evolution of the vibrational spectrum\nof bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) during the purification process needed to remove\nmetal catalyst and amorphous carbon present in arc-derived SWNT soot. We have carried out a systematic\nstudy to define the different outcomes stemming from the purification protocol (e.g., DO, DO/HCl, DO/\nHNO3, H2O2, H2O2/HCl), where dry oxidation (DO) or refluxing in H2O2 was used in a first purification step\nto remove amorphous carbon. The second step involves acid reflux (HCl or HNO3) to remove the residual\ngrowth catalyst (Ni-Y). During strong chemical processing, it appears possible to create additional defects\nwhere carbon atoms are eliminated, the ring structure is now open, localized CdC bonds are created, and\nO-containing groups can be added to this defect to stabilize the structure. Evolution of SWNT skeletal\ndisorder obtained via chemical processing was studied by Raman scattering. Higher intensity ratios of R-\nand G-band (IR/IG) are more typically found in SWNT materials with low D-band intensity and narrow G-band\ncomponents. Using IR transmission through thin films of nanotubes, we can resolve the structure due to\nfunctional groups that were present in the starting material or added through chemical processing. After\nhigh-temperature vacuum annealing of the purified material at 1100 °C, IR spectroscopy shows that most\nof the added functional groups can be removed and that the structure that remains is assigned to the one-\nand two-phonon modes of SWNTs.\nIntroduction\nSingle-walled carbon nanotubes present many exciting op-\nportunities for fundamental science and new technologies.1 An\nunfortunate outcome of many growth processes that produce\nlarge batches of bundled, free-standing single-walled carbon\nnanotubes (SWNTs) is that the product is not pure and contains\nresidual growth catalyst and amorphous carbon as important\nimpurities.2-6 Furthermore, the manufacturing and postsynthesis\nchemical purification can remove C-atoms from the tube wall\nand add functional groups to the SWNT surface.\nRaman scattering has been used for many years as a probe\nof disorder in the carbon skeleton of sp2 and sp3 carbon\nmaterials.7 Raman scattering in SWNTs is a diameter-selective\nresonant scattering process.8 The scattering is so intense that\nindividual tubes can be studied.9 Disorder in the tube wall has\nalso been studied by Raman scattering.10 Similar to studies in\nother sp2 carbons (including graphite), disorder in the graphene\nstructure of the tube wall leads to the appearance of a broad\ndisorder band or D-band.11 Recently, this band has been shown\nto be dispersive (i.e., the position changes with the excitation\nfrequency).10 Many factors should affect the strength of the\n† Department of Physics, Penn State University.\n‡ Centro de Desenvolvimento da Tecnologia Nuclear.\n§ Department of Materials Science, Penn State University.\n(1) (a) Rinzler, A.

    "D-band scattering (any change in the C-atom environment that\naffects the periodicity of the carbon structure (e.g., missing\nC-atoms and functional groups that are either added intention-\nally12,13 or added unintentionally during growth or in post growth\npurification)4-6,14-16). Raman scattering, although a powerful\nprobe of the nanotube phonons and optical excitations, has not\nbeen able to detect the identity of functional groups present on\nthe tube walls. Raman scattering, therefore, has not been found\nvery helpful in studying the chemistry of the nanotube wall.\nInfrared (IR) spectroscopy, on the other hand, has shown\nsignificant promise for the study of SWNT wall chemistry.12-21\nSeveral examples of tube wall functionalization have been\nreported where IR spectra were used to identify the functional\ngroups added to the tube wall (e.g., -COOH, -OH, other\noxygen containing groups,12,13,16-18 C-F,15 -R-oxycarbonyl\nnitrenes,19 C-Cl2,20 and -CH).21\nHere, we investigate several postsynthesis SWNT purification\nprotocols that are found popular in the literature. There are three\nsequential steps in the SWNT purification process: (1) oxidation\nto remove amorphous carbon; (2) acid reaction to remove the\nmetal growth catalyst (sometimes the metal surface is passivated\nby a shell of carbon); (3) and high-temperature annealing to\nremove functional groups that may have been added to the tube\nwall in the acid reaction and oxidation steps.5,13\nTwo of the most common methods for the removal of\namorphous carbon (AC) attempt to take advantage of the higher\nreactivity of AC with oxygen relative to SWNTs. In one case,\na dry oxidation in air at elevated temperatures is carried out.2,4,5\nSuccess has also been reported using hydrogen peroxide H2O2.6\nWe consider the changes to the tube wall for both of these\napproaches. The second step of purification involves the removal\nof the metal with acids: usually HNO35 or HCl4,5 is used. HNO3\nhas been reported, in extreme chemical conditions, to aggres-\nsively attack the tube walls, while HCl is found to be passive\nwith respect to attack on the carbons in the sample. If the metal\ncatalyst in the nanotube soot is covered with a graphitic shell\nof carbon, the oxidation step is also important to weaken this\ncoating for subsequent acid digestion of the metal. It is also\nimportant to neutralize the sample after the acid step.5 The third\nstep, high temperature annealing, is carried out either in a\nvacuum or in flowing inert gas and usually in the range of\n∼800-1100 °C.\nIn this paper, we investigate with Raman and IR spectroscopy\nhow the various protocols outlined here affect the carbon\nskeleton and the attachment of functional groups. Although there\nhas been considerable work invested to learn how to purify\nSWNT material, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has used\nboth IR and Raman spectroscopy together to follow the\nevolution of the SWNT material through these purification steps.\nExperimental Procedures\nArc discharge nanotube soot was obtained from Carbolex, Inc. The\ntubes were produced using ∼4 atomic % Ni-Y loaded carbon\nelectrodes. One large batch from the vendor was homogenized and\nstudied here. The as-delivered material was found to contain bundles\nof ∼100-400 SWNTs, ∼1-5 µm long, and with mean nanotube\ndiameter ∼1.4 nm, with most of the nanotubes in the diameter range\nof 1.2-1.6 nm, as determined by cross-sectional views of the bundle\nimaged by HRTEM.22 Also present in the soot is ∼20-30 wt %\namorphous carbon and ∼30 wt % of ∼20 nm diameter carbon-coated\nNi-Y particles, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis in air,\n[TGA; (TA Instruments, model SDT 2960)].4\nTo optimize the dry oxidation (DO) step, TGA was carried out first.\nIt was determined that a thermal soak at 355 °C for 20 min in flowing\ndry air (100 sccm) was required to achieve selective oxidation of the\namorphous carbon, while minimizing nanotube mass loss. Wet oxidation\nremoval of AC was carried out by refluxing in 30 vol % of H2O2 in\nH2O for 6 h. The solution was then filtered through a ∼1 µm pore-size\npolycarbonate membrane (Whatman, Inc.). It was found necessary to\nrepeat this procedure (H2O2 reflux/filter/wash process) 3 times to remove\nmost of the AC.\nFor metal removal (Ni-Y), we refluxed the material produced by\nstep 1 either in a strongly oxidizing 3 N HNO3 solution for 16 h or in\na weakly oxidizing 6 N HCl solution for 24 h. The details of metal\nremoval procedure can also be found in ref 5. Using TGA to analyze\nthe product after these two steps in the purification process, the wt %\nof nanotubes in the sample increased to approximately 90% (HNO3)\nor 85% (HCl), independent of whether a wet (H2O2) or dry (air)\noxidation was carried out. The remainder of the solids at this stage of\npurification typically was ∼8-12 wt % AC and ∼1-2 wt % metal.\nThe details of how to interpret the TGA data can be found in ref 4. In\nthe third and final step, we performed a high-temperature vacuum anneal\n(HTVA) at 1100 °C for 1 h at ∼10-6 Torr with a turbo-pumped vacuum\nsystem pumping on the sample kept in a open boat in a 1 in. diameter\nquartz tube centered in a furnace.\nFTIR and Raman spectra were both collected using a BOMEM\nDA3+ FT spectrometer, equipped to do conventional FTIR spectros-\ncopy, or FT-Raman spectroscopy with a Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm).\nThe nanotube material was first ultrasonicated in 2-propanol using a\nlow power bath (Aquasonic, Inc.; Model P250HT). Several drops of\nthe solution were then deposited from solution onto ZnSe substrates\nmaintained in air at ∼60 °C. The solvent from each drop was allowed\nto evaporate before the next drop was added. In this way, a film of\nnanotubes was built up such that the transmission of the film was ∼60%\nat ∼2000 cm-1. This transmission value includes the reflection/\nadsorption losses due to the substrate. The IR spectrum of just the\nnanotube film was obtained by removing the reflection/adsorption losses\nfrom the ZnSe substrate. This normalization was done by measuring\nthe single beam transmission of a clean portion on the substrate and\nwhen the beam passed through the SWNT film and substrate; the\nnormalized spectrum is just the ratio of these two spectra. For the IR\nmeasurements, the spectral resolution was 4 cm-1; for Raman spec-\ntroscopy, it was ∼1 cm-1.\nResults and Discussion\nWe first present the results obtained from Raman scattering\nthat focus on the evolution of SWNT skeletal disorder obtained\nvia chemical processing and repaired through HTVA.

    "scattering was excited using 1064 nm Nd:YAG radiation, which\nis known to couple to semiconducting nanotubes in our samples\nthat have diameters in the range of 1.2-1.6 nm.23 These\nsemiconducting tubes are easier to study because the Raman\nmodes are not broadened by interaction with the free carriers\nas they are in metallic tubes. In this case, the Raman lines can\ntake on a decidedly broader Breit-Wigner-Fano line profile.24\nThe first-order allowed Raman lines for semiconducting SWNTs\nshould have a Lorentzian profile.\nFigure 1 shows the Raman spectra of SWNT materials from\nthe raw soot and processed by various protocols as discussed\npreviously. The spectra appear in two panels: 100-300 and\n1230-1750 cm-1. The intensity of all the spectra in Figure 1\nwere normalized to yield the same intensity for the G-band at\n∼1590 cm-1. The Raman spectra, from bottom to top in the\nfigure, refer to raw soot (a), raw soot after DO at 355 °C for 20\nmin (b), raw soot after H2O2 reflux (c), raw soot after DO/HCl\n(d), and then the sequences DO/HNO3 (e), DO/HCl/HTVA at\n1100 °C (f), and DO/HNO3/HTVA at 1100 °C (g).\nThe Raman-active radial breathing modes (R-band) are\nobserved at low frequency in the left-hand panel of Figure 1.\nThe R-band can have contributions from several tubes simul-\ntaneously in resonance with the laser photon frequency. Each\ncomponent in the R-band has a frequency approximately given\nby ωRBM ) 223.7 cm-1(nm)/dt(nm),8 where dt is the tube\ndiameter. This relation is approximate in that it neglects a small\n(calculated) restoring force that adds 12-14 cm-1 to the 1/d\nterm. For more information on this detail, the readers are referred\nto ref 25. It is clear from the R-band that at least two distinct\nradii tubes exist in the CarboLex material when excited with\n1064 nm radiation (i.e., d ∼1.24 and 1.40 nm). In the 1230-\n1750 cm-1 region (right-hand panel), two Raman bands are\nobserved: a relatively broad band near ∼1300 cm-1 and a\nstronger band with structure in the ∼1580-1600 cm-1 region.\nThe band with maximum near ∼1300 cm-1 is common in\ndisordered sp2 carbon material and has been called the D-band.\nIt is activated by disorder in the sp2 carbon network. The band\nat ∼1590 cm-1 is close to that observed for well-ordered\ngraphite (i.e., E2g band at 1582 cm-1), and it is therefore often\ncalled the G-band. The G-band in well-ordered nanotubes\nactually has several components that stem from the perfect\ncylindrical symmetry of the nanotube. The D-band intensity,\nand G-bandwidth, have both been considered as probes of\nSWNT wall integrity or functionalization on the tube walls.5,7\nWe have fit the G-bands in Figure 1 to a sum of four\nLorentzian components. The components can be broadened by\ndisorder in the SWNT skeletal structure. To take advantage of\nthis link between Raman line width and order in the carbon\nskeleton of the SWNT, we have had to carry out a careful line\nshape analysis. The solid line in the figure is the result of our\nline shape analysis. We find that the Lorentzian line width\nparameters for the G-band components of the raw soot are not\naffected by either dry oxidation (DO) or by a two-step treatment\ninvolving dry oxidation followed by HCl treatment (DO/HCl).\nThis suggests that these chemical processing steps produce little\nor no change in the carbon skeleton of the SWNT. Similarly,\nthere is no increase in intensity in the D-band after DO or DO/\nHCl processing. However, this is not the case for wet oxidation\n(H2O2) to remove amorphous carbon or after using 3 N HNO3\nto digest metallic particles. In the case of this chemical\nprocessing, very noticeable changes in the Raman spectrum can\nbe observed, even by examining the Raman spectra by eye\n(Figure 1). For H2O2 processing only (Figure 1c) and DO/HNO3\nprocessing (Figure 1e), a careful line shape analysis was also\ncarried out. After this chemical processing, the G-band could\nbe well-fitted by a simple rigid upshift of the four Lorentzian\ncomponents identified in the spectrum of the raw soot (i.e., all\nrelative intensities of the G-band components remain the same,\nbut all the components were broadened by the same amount).\nThe results of these G-band analyses are seen as the solid curves\npassing through the data in Figure 1. After H2O2 reflux, and\nalso after DO/HNO3 processing, we find that the G-band\ncomponents are broadened by factors of 1.8 and 2, respectively.\nFurthermore, the G-band has upshifted by ∼4 cm-1 (H2O2) and\n∼10 cm-1 (HNO3). Previous experimental and theoretical work\nhas shown that doping SWNTs with either electron donors or\nacceptors26,27 results in noticeable shifts in the high-frequency\nvibrational modes.

    "p-doping or oxidizing) has been shown to result in an upshift\nin the G-band peak,25,26 as observed here. This conclusion is\nconsistent with extensive observations of chemical charge-\ntransfer reactions in graphite,28a C60,28b and in SWNTs.26,27 An\nupshift of the G-band after refluxing SWNT samples in HNO3\nhas been observed by several groups.5,6,12 They identified the\nupshift of the G-band with electron transfer from the nanotube\nbundle to form NO3- anions. This interpretation is consistent\nwith work in graphite intercalation compounds.27 For the case\nof H2O2, the identity of the anion formed as a result of the\nrefluxing is less clear. In fact, the G-band upshift in this case is\nprobably associated with negative -OH groups chemically\nbonded to the tube walls. This proposal is consistent with our\nIR results, which we discuss further next.\nThe intensity of the D-band in SWNT soot processed by DO/\nHNO3 or just by H2O2 is enhanced. The band also broadens\nand upshifts. The upshift of the D-band is large (∼30 cm-1)\nfor DO/HNO3. It should be noted that the D-band is a dispersive\nRaman band whose position changes with the excitation laser\nfrequency.10 It is not unexpected that the D-band should also\nshift at the same time the G-band is upshifting; this is just\nanother signal of charge transfer. Of course, the increase in the\nD-band intensity should be interpreted as a decrease in the\nstructural order in the SWNT bundles. It is likely that the\ndisorder stems from three factors: added functional groups,\nmissing carbon atoms in the wall, and inhomogeneous decora-\ntion of the tube wall by NO3- anions. It is well-known that\nintroducing disorder to an sp2 carbon network introduces a broad\ndisorder-induced D- band at ∼1350 cm-1. It is less well-known\nthat a second disorder-induced band often appears as a high\nfrequency shoulder to the G-band. This shoulder is located at\n∼1620 cm-1 and is referred to as the G*-band.7 In the current\nstudy, although we cannot see direct evidence for this G*-band\nas a shoulder to the G-band, we do observe an increase in\nscattering intensity on the high-frequency side of the G-band.\nIt was found necessary to incorporate a broad Lorentzian band\ncentered near ∼1600 cm-1 to fit Raman spectra to account for\nthis scattering. It could well be that the presence of this 1600\ncm-1 component in our fits is just a measure of new G*\nscattering.\nWe also considered the processing combination of H2O2/HCl\nfor the first two steps. However, we have not shown the Raman\nspectrum of H2O2/HCl in Figure 1 since the subsequent HCl\nstep has no measurable effect on the Raman spectrum.\nFinally, it is very interesting to observe the changes in the\nRaman spectrum associated with HTVA (high-temperature\nvacuum annealing). As observed in the Raman spectrum of\nFigure 1f,g, a vacuum anneal at 1100 °C for 1 h on DO/HCl\nand DO/HNO3 processed material is very dramatic. All the lines\nnarrow, the D-band intensity decreases, and the Raman spectrum\nreturns to that of the raw soot. This indicates that most of the\nwall disorder introduced by chemical processing can be removed\nby the HTVA step. In fact, it appears that the skeletal holes\n(i.e., missing C-atoms) produced in the SWNT wall may drift\nto the open tube ends where they evaporate. We can observe\nthe removal of the functional groups via IR spectroscopy, as\ndiscussed next.\nAlthough the physical or chemical reasons are not yet clear,\nwe find that the ratio of the scattering intensity in the R-band\n(IR) to that of the G-band (IG) is sensitive to the chemical\nprocessing. Our results show that higher ratios of IR/IG are more\ntypically found in SWNT materials with low D-band intensity\nand narrow G-band components. In the case of DO/HCl\nprocessing, it is difficult to notice any significant change in either\nthe D-band intensity or the G-band component width relative\nto that in the raw soot. However, the ratio IR/IG changes\nnoticeably. After HTVA, the IR/IG ratio increases, and the ratio\nreturns to that observed in the raw soot. We propose that the\ndecrease in IR/IG is associated with a reduction in IR. IR is\ntherefore proposed to be more sensitive to disorder than IG.\nThe major impact of chemical treatment on the R-band is a\nreduction of intensity. However, we can also say the following\nabout the effects of chemical treatment on the R-band fre-\nquency: (1) HCl has little or no effect on the R-band frequency;\n(2) H2O2 produces a small upshift of ∼4 cm-1; and (3) HNO3\nmay produce a small (∼1-2 cm-1) upshift, but this upshit is\ndifficult to quantify given the weak nature of the R-band after\nnitric acid treatment. It is interesting to consider why the shift\nof the G- and D-band can be so easily observed while the R-band\nshift is so small as to be difficult to measure. The reasons could\nbe many (e.g., the difference in the percent effects of doping\non the bond bending vs bond stretching force constants and the\nadmixture of the bond bending and stretching in the various\neigenmodes (e.g., R-, D-, and G-) are different and therefore a\ncomplicating factor). However, consider the following argument.\nIf we say that the mode frequency is simply related to the square\nroot of the change in an effective force constant, then a 0.1%\nchange in the effective force constant for a particular mode leads\nto a 0.05% change in the mode frequency. Further, if we\nconsider the same percent change in the effective force constant\nfor the modes at ∼160 cm-1 (R), ∼1300 cm-1 (D), and ∼1600\ncm-1 (G), then we would expect the same percentage shift in\nthe R-, D-, and G-mode frequencies. However, in terms of the\nactual cm-1 shift, the high frequency modes would then upshift\nmuch more than the R-bands because they have significantly\nhigher frequency (i.e., a 10 cm-1 upshift of the G-band is\nequivalent to a ∼1 cm-1 upshift in a ∼160 cm-1 R-band mode).\nIt is difficult at this time to separate out the effects of strain\ndue to adding functional groups to the tube wall and the effects\nof strain due to electron transfer to (or from) the carbon skeleton.\nCompressive strain of the C-C bond or a change of the bond\nangles can lead to an upshift in vibrational mode frequencies.\nWe can add that studies of charge transfer-induced strain in\ngraphite intercalation compound space (GICs) have found\nsimilar upshifts to what we observe in carbon nanotubes exposed\nto nitric acid or hydrogen peroxide. For example, the reaction\nof nitric acid with graphite under mild conditions is thought to\nlead to the intercalation of nitrate ion between the graphene\nlayers, which removes electrons from the sp2 carbon network\nand induces an upshift in the G-band of the GIC by ∼10-20\ncm-1, similar to what is observed here for SWNTs. In the case\nof GICs, it is thought that the reaction with nitric acid under\nmild conditions does not disrupt the carbon skeleton via the\nremoval of carbon and/or the addition of functional groups.\nWe have also examined HRTEM images of bundles of\nSWNTs that were subjected to various chemical processes.\nInspection of these images indicates to us that HRTEM is far\n(28) (a) Eklund, P.

    "less sensitive in exposing disorder in the carbon skeleton than\nRaman scattering. Only under extreme processing conditions\nin HNO3 were we able to see evidence of large holes in the\nnanotube wall. We can conclude that Raman scattering is far\nbetter a probe of disorder when the tube walls are largely intact.\nNext, we show how the IR spectroscopy of SWNT material\nduring processing can be used as an important complementary\nprobe to Raman scattering. We follow the evolution of the IR\nspectrum with the same set of samples as discussed previously.\nUnfortunately, the IR activity associated with added functional\ngroups is somewhat difficult to observe. After chemical process-\ning, the wt % fraction of the sample identified with functional\ngroups is perhaps on the order of ∼5 wt %, at the most. Only\nthose groups that are most numerous and those having strong\nIR activity will be detected. Furthermore, the optical absorption\nin the mid-IR region is dominated by electronic contributions\nfrom the SWNTs. To see the vibrational modes of the functional\ngroups (and the IR modes of SWNT29), the electronic contribu-\ntion should be removed from the spectrum. First, we show how\nthis electronic contribution is removed.\nIn Figure 2, we show the actual normalized transmission\nspectrum for a SWNT film on a ZnSe substrate (indicated as\nspectra a). The effects of reflection/absorption loss in the ZnSe\nhave been removed from spectra a, as discussed in the\nExperimental Procedures. To enhance the visibility of the sharp\nstructure, we subtract the background identified with the\nelectronic contribution by fitting it to a cubic polynomial, shown\nas the dotted line spectra b. The difference spectrum (i.e., spectra\na and b) is shown at the bottom of Figure 2 as spectra c. The\nparameters of the cubic polynomial are chosen to produce a\nflat baseline for spectra c.\nIn Figure 3, we show the evolution of the mid-IR spectrum\nof SWNT material after processing for amorphous carbon\nremoval (i.e., oxidation step). The spectra in Figure 3 are the\ndifference spectra; the particular electronic contribution has been\nremoved. The difference spectrum for the raw soot appears at\nthe bottom, and at the top, we display the difference spectrum\nof purified material processed by DO/HCl/HTVA ) 1100 °C\nand by DO/HNO3/HTVA ) 1100 °C. These top two spectra\nare for purified and annealed SWNTs. They represent the\nvibrational contribution of the cleanest material. The structure\nthat appears in these top two spectra should either be identified\nwith SWNT IR modes29 or with the most tenaciously bound\nfunctional groups, or defects. According to studies on other sp2\ncarbons, on HTVA ) 1100 °C, treatment should remove most\nof the functional groups (the hydrocarbon groups are the most\ndifficult to remove).30a These upper two spectra should be very\nhelpful in setting the baseline for intrinsic SWNT IR activity\nand allow the identification of functional groups that become\nattached during chemical processing. We begin with a brief\ndescription of the structure in these two top spectra. First of\nall, there are two artifacts identified with the spectrometer in\nall the spectra in Figure 3: a prominent triplet at 2900 cm-1\nand a weaker narrow peak at ∼1250 cm-1.31 These are identified\nby the asterisks in the figure. However, the triplet at ∼2900\ncm-1 has been assigned as C-Hn functional groups introduced\nby atomic hydrogen generated in cold plasma22 or as a C-H\nstretching mode of the alkyl chain in octadecylamido (ODA)\nfunctionalized SWNTs.17 In our spectra, we believe that the 2900\ncm-1 triplet is associated with hydrocarbon contamination in\nour spectrometer.31 Most of the peaks in the top two baseline\nspectra on purified and annealed material in the range of 800-\n1760 cm-1 have been assigned previously to first- and second-\norder IR modes of SWNTs.29 It should also be mentioned that\nall of the structures seen in these top two spectra have also been\nobserved in material vacuum annealed to 1400 °C.29 So it is\nunlikely that the peaks in the top two spectra in Figure 3 can\nbe identified with functional groups, as they should be removed\nduring a 1400 °C HTVA.30a\nWe now discuss the new IR bands that appear after chemical\nprocessing. For the case of oxidative removal of AC, the results\nare shown for DO and H2O2 reflux in the middle of Figure 3.\nThe results after acid processing are shown in Figure 4.\nWe consider first the IR spectrum of the raw soot (Figure\n3a).

This difference\nspectroscopy can pick up spectral artifacts not associated with optical\nabsorption in the sample. The possibility of remnants of spectral structures\nin the incident photon beam due to the source and optics must therefore be\nconsidered. To determine which absorption features in the difference\nspectrum should be identified with the carbon film, and which should be\nlabeled as artifacts, we carried out optical transmission experiments of a\nseries of samples (same SWNT material) with increasing film thickness.\nThose peaks identified with true IR absorption in the film grew in intensity\nwith the film thickness and in a correlated way. Two bands (∼2900 cm-1\ntriplet and 1260 cm-1 peak) did not exhibit this behavior, and they are\nidentified with spectral artifacts. The 2900 cm-1 triplet was also observed\nafter a 1400 °C anneal that should remove all functional groups. All other\nIR peaks in the difference spectra of Figures 3 and 4 showed the anticipated\nincrease in optical density with an increase in the SWNT film thickness\non the substrate.\nFigure 2.

    "example, the 1101 cm-1 band in Figure 3a is located within\nthe range expected for C-O stretching modes in ethers, esters,\nalcohols, or phenol compounds, and the 1710 cm-1 band can\nbe assigned to carbonyl (CdO) stretching in ketones, aldehydes,\nor carboxylic acid groups.30 For aldehyde groups, one or two\nbands assigned to the aldehydic C-H stretching, or the Fermi\nresonance between the fundamental aldehydic C-H stretching\nand the first overtone of the aldehydic C-H bending vibration,\nshould generally appear in the 2695-2830 cm-1 range.32\nHowever, these high-frequency bands are not observed, so the\n1710 cm-1 band is probably associated with either ketone or\ncarboxylic acid groups. A prominent broad band (3100-3600\ncm-1) can be observed in two of the IR spectra of Figure 3.\nThis broad band is assigned to contributions from a variety of\nO-H stretching modes. The width indicates that several different\n-OH containing groups are probably present in many different\nchemical and carbon environments. The frequency is somewhat\nlower than observed for free molecules and is instead charac-\nteristic of coupled acid and alcoholic hydroxyl functionalities.\nSince the -OH stretch band is present between 3100 and 3600\ncm-1, the CdO band at 1710 cm-1 should probably be identified\nwith carboxylic acid groups. We also should consider the\npresence of ketone groups. If a high frequency shoulder is seen\non the ∼1710 cm-1 band (the shoulder is apparent in the figure),\nwe should also consider the presence of R,â-unsaturated and\nbenzoate esters. Since there is AC and possible polyaromatic\nhydrocarbons in the raw soot, it must be said that the functional\ngroups we can see by their IR signature in the raw soot are not\nFigure 3.

    "necessarily on the tube walls but could be elsewhere in the\nsample. As reported by Zhang et al.,16 a very broad band at\n∼1100 cm-1 was observed in the raw SWNT soot grown by\nthe CVD process. However, they did not make any assignment\nfor this band. Zhang et al.16 and Kukovecz et al.12 did not\nobserve a band at ∼1700 cm-1 in their raw soot samples.\nAfter dry oxidation (DO) of the raw SWNT soot at 355 °C\nfor 20 min (Figure 3(b)), the IR band at ∼1100 cm-1 is reduced,\nand the broad -OH absorption between 3100 and 3600 cm-1\nhas been removed. These observations suggest that many of\nthe functional groups seen in the spectrum of the raw soot\n(Figure 3a) may be attached to amorphous carbon or other\ncarbonaceous fragments that were removed by dry oxidation.\nOne intriguing feature in Figure 3b is the appearance of\nadditional absorption in a broad band with structure located\nbetween ∼1300 and 1600 cm-1; we are unable to assign this\nband. It is also interesting that although very little or no change\nwas observed in the Raman spectrum upon dry oxidation of\nthe raw soot, a considerable change in the IR spectrum is\nevident. Our IR data show clearly that oxygen containing\nfunctional groups appear after dry oxidation (∼1300 and 1600\ncm-1). Thus, IR can be seen to be a complimentary and powerful\nprobe of chemical changes in this carbon system.\nA reflux in 30% H2O2 has also been reported to remove AC\nfrom SWNT material.6 The AC phase can be preferentially\noxidized to CO2 gas. For our H2O2-processed sample, the IR\nspectrum (Figure 3c) exhibits enhanced absorption near ∼1730\ncm-1. This is consistent with the formation of additional\ncarboxyl groups on the SWNT surface. The band in the H2O2\nprocessed material is enhanced and upshifted to 1734 cm-1,\nrelative to its counterpart in the raw soot (∼1710 cm-1). After\nH2O2 reflux, very broad bands also appear in the ∼3230-3500\ncm-1 range and are identified with O-H stretching modes. The\nbroad low-frequency component of this O-H band with a peak\nat ∼3234 cm-1 (lower in intensity) is identified with O-H\nstretching from coupled carboxylic acid groups and the higher\nfrequency band at ∼3390 cm-1 with alcoholic or phenolic\ngroups. The frequency of these vibrations is sensitive to\nhydrogen bonding between functional groups. The low frequen-\ncies observed for both broad -OH bands in Figure 3b may be\nthe result of coupling to adjacent oxygen containing groups.\nThe C-O stretching vibrations in alcohols and phenols also\nexhibit bands in the 1000-1260 cm-1 range; their frequency\ndepends on the details of the coupling to C-C stretching\nvibrations. The bands at ∼1035 and 1100 cm-1, shown in the\nspectrum of Figure 3c, could therefore be tentatively identified\nwith C-C-O stretching in unsaturated hydroxyl groups, and\nthe small peak appearing at ∼1315 cm-1 in Figure 3c might be\nassociated with the characteristic vibrational mode resulting from\ninteraction between O-H bending and C-O stretching in phenol\ngroups.32\nThere are several interesting changes in the IR spectrum at\nhigh frequency (>1500 cm-1) after H2O2 processing. We\nobserve a broadening and intensity enhancement of the absorp-\ntion band in the 1550-1650 cm-1 region. A band at ∼1570\ncm-1 in the raw soot (Figure 3a) that we have identified with\na fundamental SWNT mode29 appears to have broadened and\nupshifted to ∼1585 cm-1 after H2O2 processing. It also now\ncontains new structure at ∼1620 and 1650 cm-1, and the higher\nfrequency modes are likely due to conjugation of CdO with\nCdC bonds or interaction between localized CdC bonds and\ncarboxylic acids and ketones. Of course, there are many ways\nto couple and shift these high-frequency modes, so it is difficult\nto make definite assignments. For example, both intermolecular\nand intramolecular hydrogen bonding with hydroxyl groups\nresult in delocalization of the π electrons of both unsaturated\ngroups or CdO groups. These couplings reduce the double-\nbond character of the CdO bond and downshift the IR bands.\nFor example, the CdO stretching mode of a quinone group,\nwithout conjugation, usually appears at ∼1715 cm-1. Quinones\nthat have both carbonyl groups in the same ring (which therefore\nhas conjugation) absorb in the 1655-1690 cm-1 region. With\nextended conjugation, in which the carbonyl groups are coupled\nweakly and appear in different rings, the absorption downshifts\nto the 1635-1655 cm-1 region. Hence, there are many pos-\nsibilities here, and model compound reactions with clean SWNT\nmaterial will be needed to sort this out. Mawhinney et al.\nreported FTIR spectroscopic studies of the oxidation and etching\nof SWNTs using ozone at 298 K. They assigned a 1650 cm-1\nband to the CdO stretching mode of quinone groups added\npreferentially to the ends of the tubes.18 In our case, the\nappearance of also O-H stretching modes after H2O2 reflux\nleads us to believe that coupling effects (i.e., both intermolecular\nand intramolecular hydrogen bonding with hydroxyl groups)\nalso might be responsible for the downshift in the CdO\nstretching mode, besides the production of surface-bound\nquinone groups with extended conjugation.\nIt seems conclusive from an IR band analysis that an H2O2\nreflux approach to AC removal leads to a substantial increase\nin carboxylic acid and hydroxyl (phenolic and alcoholic) groups\nrelative to the amount found in the raw soot or after DO. At\nthe same time, our Raman spectral analysis, discussed previ-\nously, shows an enhancement in the D-band scattering intensity\nand a broadening of the G-band for H2O2 processing but not\nfor DO processing. From TGA and HRTEM, we know that\nH2O2 reflux definitely removes most of the AC component from\nthe material. So, there is a consistent picture of the difference\nin the outcomes from dry oxidation (DO) and H2O2 reflux of\nraw SWNT material: while both oxidative processes lead to\nremoval of AC, H2O2 reflux yields a much stronger function-\nalization of the nanotube wall. For electronic applications of\nprocessed SWNTs, for example, DO should be preferred. Recall\nthat the H2O2 reflux was observed to upshift the G-band by ∼\n4 cm-1. The IR band that we have identified with one of the\nnanotube (tangential) IR modes also upshifts (by ∼15 cm-1).\nIt can be seen from our work here that band upshifting can occur\nboth by charge transfer (NO3-) and functionalization with\nnegatively charged groups (-OH). In both cases, the upshifting\nof these tangential SWNT bands is associated with the with-\ndrawal of π electrons.\nA SWNT is a macroscopic realization of a resonant CdC\nconjugated system. During strong chemical processing, it\nappears possible to create additional defects where carbon atoms\nare eliminated, the ring structure is now open, localized CdC\nbonds are created, and oxygen containing groups can be added\nto this defect to stabilize the structure. This should lead to an\nupshifting of the IR CdC bands, and a CdO band should\nappear. A strong coupling between neighboring CdO functional\n(32) Silverstein, R. M.; Webster, F. X.

    "groups will downshift the CdO band and may be a signature\nof a high density of CdO groups. Zhang et al.16 observed that\nthe band at ∼1735 cm-1 that we identify with -COOH addition\ngradually downshifted to ∼1720 cm-1 with longer acid treat-\nment. They suggested that longer acid treatment introduces more\n-COOH and -OH groups to the tube walls and ends, and this\nlowers the frequency of the -CdO stretching mode.16 Their\nobservation supports our assignment of new structures at ∼1620\nand 1650 cm-1 that appear after refluxing the tubes in H2O2.\nWe next turn to the analysis of the IR spectroscopic signatures\nof acid processing of SWNT material to remove the metal\ngrowth catalyst. The material was first processed to remove the\nAC. In Figure 4, we show the IR spectra of DO/HCl (spectrum\na) and DO/HNO3 (spectrum b) processed material. The effects\non the IR spectrum from H2O2/HCl processing are indicated in\nFigure 4c. We consider first the effect of HCl reflux on DO\nmaterial. Basically, the only significant changes in the IR\nspectrum after HCl reflux is a reduction in the absorption near\n∼1400 cm-1 and an enhancement in absorption near ∼1100\ncm-1. As discussed previously, we have had difficulty assigning\nthe 1400 cm-1 band to a particular functionality. The fact that\nthe 1400 cm-1 band intensity is reduced certainly strengthens\nour opinion that the ∼1400 cm-1 band is associated with an\nunknown functional group rather than a nanotube mode. Earlier,\nwe assigned the ∼1100 cm-1 band to C-O stretching; C-O\ncontaining groups appear to have been added by HCl reflux.\nHowever, the chemistry behind these C-O additions needs to\nbe clarified in further work.\nInterestingly, for DO/HCl processing of raw SWNT soot, little\nor no changes in the Raman scattering from the D- or the\nG-bands were observed (i.e., the D-band intensity and the\nG-band component widths did not change). However, the IR\nspectrum shows a clear change: C-O containing functional\ngroups have been added to the tube wall. Hence, the reduction\nin the Raman intensity IR/IG for DO/HCl processed SWNT must\nbe due to C-O functionalization.\nProcessing DO material with HNO3 can be seen in Figure\n4b to lead to the addition of carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups\n(cf., broad bands with maxima at ∼3234 and ∼3412 cm-1).\nFrom the relative intensity of these two broad components, we\ncan conclude that HNO3 leads to a larger population of carboxyl\nrelative to hydroxyl group on the SWNT wall. Several\ngroups12,16,17 have also observed the enhancement of the band\nat ∼1730 cm-1 after refluxing SWNT samples in HNO3 or a\nmixed acid such as HNO3/H2SO4. They assigned this band to a\nCdO stretching mode in carboxylic acid groups. We also\nobserve an upshift in the SWNT band at ∼1575 cm-1 (DO) to\n∼1586 cm-1 (DO/HNO3) that is consistent with charge transfer\n(i.e., via the attachment of NO3- ions) and possibly mitigated\nby localization of CdC bonds and coupling to CdO modes, as\ndiscussed previously. The band in the DO/HNO3 material\n(Figure 4b) at ∼1230 cm-1 probably should be assigned to the\nO-H bending mode or C-O stretching mode.\nWe next consider, from the perspective of IR spectroscopy,\nthe effect of a completely wet purification of the SWNT soot\n(i.e., H2O2 reflux to remove the amorphous carbon and a mild\nmineral acid reflux (HCl) to remove the metal). To see the\neffects of HCl on the wet oxidized material, we need to compare\nspectrum c in Figure 4 to that discussed previously in Figure 3.\nFrom this comparison, it is clear that HCl induces replacement\nreactions that remove many of the oxygen containing functional\ngroups. This view is consistent with two observations: (i) the\nbroad ∼3390 cm-1 O-H stretching band in H2O2 refluxed\nmaterial (Figure 3c) (from the hydroxyl groups) is now less\nintense. The high-frequency component is also upshifted from\n3390 to 3460 cm-1, indicating a decoupling of hydroxyl groups,\nconsistent with a decrease in their population. (ii) The broad\nstrong bands in the ∼1500-1700 cm-1 region for H2O2 refluxed\nmaterial (Figure 3c) show a significant reduction in intensity.\nThe bands are now narrower. Similar to the IR spectrum for\nthe DO/HNO3 material, one relatively sharp band at ∼1585\ncm-1 identified with the IR active tangential nanotube mode is\nobserved, upshifted by charge transfer from its position at ∼1570\ncm-1 in the raw soot.\nFinally, we consider the IR signatures that evolve from a short\nterm high-temperature vacuum anneal (HTVA) of the DO/HCl\nand DO/HNO3 material. These spectra appear at the top of\nFigure 3. We have discussed the outcome from this anneal from\nthe perspective of the Raman bands. As discussed previously,\nthe Raman data show that an anneal in ∼1100 °C in a vacuum\nfor 1 h reduces the D-band intensity and the G-band component\nwidth, returning the SWNT structure to almost the same\ncondition as was observed for tubes in the raw soot. We expect\nthat high temperatures should remove many of the functional\ngroups produced by dry or wet chemical processing. Indeed,\naccording to a review of many studies of functional groups on\nhigh surface area amorphous and graphitic carbons by\nKinoshita,30a various groups leave at characteristic temperatures.\nSummarizing his review, carboxylic and lactone groups begin\nto decompose first at about 250 °C and are volatilized. In the\n500-900 °C range, phenol and quinone groups have decom-\nposed almost entirely. And at 900 °C, the -OH content\ndecreases significantly, and other oxygen containing surface\ngroups are almost completely eliminated. Hydrogen, on the other\nhand, is removed from amorphous carbon by heat treatment\nbetween 900 and 1200 °C. On the basis of the review by\nKinoshita,30a our HTVA at 1100 °C for 1 h should remove all\noxygen containing functional groups; we expect also that any\n-CH groups present should also be decreased drastically.29\nComparing the IR spectra for DO/HNO3/HTVA and DO/HCl/\nHTVA to that of the raw soot (cf., Figure 3a,d,e), we see that\nthe broad bands in the 3000-3600 cm-1 region are removed,\nas well as many of the broader and stronger bands below 1600\ncm-1 present in the starting material. Furthermore, after removal\nof AC by H2O2 reflux (cf., Figure 3c) and DO (cf., Figure 3b),\nbroad -OH bands remain in the material, which we have\nattributed to functional groups. By comparing the top two IR\nspectra in Figure 3 to those that appear below in the same figure,\nas well as to those for acid-processed material in Figure 4, we\ncan say that HTVA indeed removes most of the functional\ngroups either present in the starting material or added by\nchemical processing.\nHowever, it is clear from the top two IR spectra in Figure 3\nthat there are some small differences in the purified HTVA\nmaterial, depending on whether HCl or HNO3 was used to\nremove the metal. Annealing of the DO/HCl material at higher\ntemperatures (up to ∼1400 °C) generated a material whose IR\nspectrum is almost identical to that shown for DO/HNO3/HTVA\nmaterial in Figure 3e.

The\nassignments we make in Table 1 are plausible but are by no\nmeans certain. Follow-on work on model compounds will need\nto be done to confirm these tentative assignments.\nIn summary, this work presents a first step toward the use of\nIR and Raman spectroscopy as a probe for SWNT chemistry\nand the evaluation of purified SWNT material after reactions.\nWe expect that much progress will now be made in understand-\ning SWNT chemistry, as cleaner SWNT material becomes\navailable and these spectroscopies are applied to probe the\nmaterial. Higher annealing temperatures should be avoided,\nhowever, as nanotube coalescence and other transformations\nbegin to take place at 1400-1600 °C.22 This work represents\nan early study using both IR and Raman spectroscopy to observe\nthe effect of several common chemical schemes to remove\namorphous carbon and growth catalysts from large batches of\nARC derived SWNTs. Our objective was to learn which of these\nprocesses produced the most damage to the carbon skeleton and\nwhich functionalities were added via exposure to specific\nchemicals. This work is one of the first, if not the first, to\nindicate which purification procedure is to be preferred based\non observations of damage to the carbon skeleton or added\nfunctionalities. This work is the first of its kind to address\npurification from the vantage point of vibrational spectroscopy.\nConsiderable progress, however, is needed to take this work to\na higher (more quantitative) level, such as could be obtained\nfrom correlating IR intensities with percent functionalization.\nThis type of study is best done with model SWNT compounds.\nIn the present work, we must be content to simply learn about\nthe effects of the particular (commonly used) purification\nscheme by noticing how they affect the D-band Raman\nscattering, or for example, when the intensity from carboxyl\nvibrations increases or decreases. The next step, set aside for\nfuture work, is to make quantitative contact between IR\nspectroscopy (e.g., IR band intensities) and some other probe\n(e.g., TG-MS) that can tell us about the nature and quantity of\nfunctionalites present. It is hoped that this work will spark\ninterest in model compound reactions of SWNTs with various\nreagents and that IR and Raman spectroscopy can be used to\ncharacterize the reactions.\nAcknowledgment.
