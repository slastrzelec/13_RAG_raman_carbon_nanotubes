Generally, a scaffold made of synthetic polymer blended\nwith nanoﬁllers was proven to be a very promising biomaterial for tissue engineering, however\nthe choice of components for the said scaffold remains questionable. The objects of the presented\nstudy were novel composites consisting of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and two types of graphene\nmaterials: graphene oxide (GO) and partially reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The technique of choice,\nthat was used to characterize the obtained composites, was Raman micro-spectroscopy. It revealed\nthat the composite PCL/GO differs substantially from the PCL/rGO composite. The incorporation\nof the GO particles into the polymer inﬂuenced the structure organisation of the polymeric matrix\nmore signiﬁcantly than rGO. The crystallinity parameters conﬁrmed that the level of crystallinity is\ngenerally higher in the PCL/GO membrane in comparison to PCL/rGO (and even in raw PCL) that\nleads to the conclusion that the GO acts as a nucleation agent enhancing the crystallization of PCL.\nInterestingly, the characteristics of the studied nanoﬁllers, for example: the level of the organisation\n(D/G ratio) and the in-plane size of the nano-crystallites (La) almost do not differ. However, they\nhave an ability to inﬂuence polymeric matrix differently.\nKeywords: polymer nanocomposite; poly(ε-caprolactone); reduced graphene oxide (rGO); graphene\noxide (GO); Raman micro-spectroscopy\n1. Introduction\nIn the last several years there has been a rapid growth in the ﬁeld of tissue engineering\nfor medical purposes caused by its huge potential as an alternative to current traditional\ntransplant procedures. The ultimate goal of tissue engineering is to design a scaffold that\nwould behave as a native extracellular matrix supporting growth and coordinating the\nregulation of host cells [1].\nA number of synthetic polymers were tested as a basic material of scaffold because of\ntheir high mechanical strength, biocompatibility and low costs. Among them the poly(ε-\ncaprolactone) (PCL) emerged to be highly suitable for application in the ﬁeld of bone\ntissue engineering [2]. However, PCL, semi-crystalline aliphatic polyester, despite having\ndistinctive mechanical qualities, long-term biodegradability, great solubility and excep-\ntional blend-compatibility, is reported to be not applicable alone. The serious drawback of\nraw PCL is its hydrophobicity as well as its mechanical properties that are not sufﬁcient\nJ. Compos. Sci. 2021, 5, 20. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcs5010020\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcs\n",

It has already been proven\nthat graphene derivatives used as a modifying nanoparticles (in low concentration due to\ntheir toxicity in higher doses [5,6] are able to modify physical and mechanical properties,\nand also act as nucleation agents to enhance the crystallization of PCL [7]. Furthermore,\ngraphene derivatives are able to improve the biocompatibility and osteogenic potential of\nthe PCL scaffold by promoting adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of cell [6,8–16].\nA single graphene layer is a two-dimensional graphitic structure of sp2 hybridization\ncarbon atoms (one atom thick) that forms a honeycomb pattern with excellent mechanical,\nthermal, and electrical properties [7].\nIn the presented research two types of graphene derivatives were used to obtain\npolymer (PCL) nanocomposites: graphene oxide (GO) and partially reduced graphene\noxide (rGO). The GO have functional, oxygen-containing groups attached to their surface\nthat gives them unique properties, hydrophilic character that prevents their aggregation\nin water, and also improves their biocompatibility and ability of blending with the polar\npolymers such as PCL [8,17]. Graphene materials are also considered to be especially\nattractive compared to any other carbon nanomaterials because of their lower levels of\nmetallic impurities [18]. Generally, the GO is obtained by oxidation under oxidative\ntreatment of either synthetic or natural graphite. The GO can further be modiﬁed by the\nreduction pathway into the reduced form of the graphene, i.e., rGO. In the rGO the created\nchemical functional groups on the surface of the graphene layer, as well as on its edges\nare removed due to the reduction process. Both forms of graphene, i.e., GO and rGO,\nare the subject of numerous studies due to their potential applications in technique and\nmedicine [19].\nIn the given study graphite-derived graphene structures were incorporated into the\nPCL polymeric matrix (Figure 1). The quantity of both forms of graphenes (GO, rGO) was\nset at a low level of 0.5 wt% in order to prevent any toxic effects. The main aim of the study\nwas to decode and differentiate the phenomenon that occurs in the polymer in contact with\nthe GO that is rich in hydrophilic functional groups, and with rGO that lacked most of\nthose groups. Raman spectroscopy was the method of choice on account of its exceptional\nability to test short-range ordering. The procedure of curve ﬁtting in the chosen regions\nwas performed in order to obtain the parameters of crystallinity of both the PCL matrix\nand graphene components.\n",

The Graphene Oxide and Reduced Graphene Oxide Preparation\nThe GO samples were obtained from a graphite precursor (the average grain size\nwas 16 µm) by its oxidation according to a modiﬁed Hummers method, whereas the rGO\nsamples were prepared by their chemical reduction to obtain the reduced structure of\nGO [20–22]. For the manufacture of GO we used a mixture of sulfuric acid (VI), sodium\nnitrate (V) and potassium permanganate. The thermal method of reducing GO was used,\ninvolving heating the sample at 180 C for 10 h. As a result of this process, oxygen functional\ngroups were removed from the surface of GO grains, and at the same time the structure of\ngraphene with sp2 hybridization was restored. However, as a result of this process there\n",

Preparation of the Nanocomposite Membranes\nThe 10 wt% solution of the PCL (poly(ε-caprolactone) (Mn 45 000) from Sigma Aldrich,\nPoland) in dichloromethane (DCM) was stirred overnight at RT. The GO/rGO were dis-\npersed in DCM. To obtain a uniform dispersion of the graphene materials, the ultrasonic\nbath (10 min; L&R Manufacturing Co., Kearny, NJ, USA) and the soniﬁcation process\n(3 min; 30% amplitude; BANDELIN electronic GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) were\nused. Suspension was immediately mixed with the PCL solution and sonicated again (the\nsame conditions as above). The mixtures of GO/rGO in the PCL were then poured onto a\nPetri dish. The time of PCL crystallization was about 24 h and due to different conditions\nof evaporating, the top and bottom membranes’ surfaces differ. The amount of nanoaddi-\ntion was the same for both types of nanocomposites and equal to 0.5 wt%. The obtained\npolymer nanocomposite membranes were denoted as PCL/GO and PCL/rGO. The raw\nPCL membrane was manufactured with the same method and denoted as reference a PCL\nmembrane. The obtained materials are presented in Figure 1.\n2.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a Nova NanoSEM 200\nmicroscope (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The morphology of additives and microstruc-\ntural observation of polymer composites were performed in low vacuum conditions, using\nthe secondary electron detectors (LVD and Helix) and the accelerated voltage of 5–18 kV.\n2.4. Contact Angle Measurements\nThe contact angle measurements were conducted on a SAM10Mk1 (KRÜS, Hamburg,\nGermany) goniometer using deionized water and methylene iodide. The top and bottom\nsurfaces of the membranes were tested.\n2.5. X-ray Diffraction Analysis\nThe X-ray powder diffraction data for the reference PCL membrane and PCL/GO and\nPCL/rGO nanomaterials in the form of membranes were collected on the Philips diffrac-\ntometer type X’Pert Pro in the Bragg-Brentano geometry. CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154184 nm\nwavelength) diffracted by sample was selected by a graphite monochromator. The scanning\nvoltage of the X-ray tube was 40 kV, the current was 30 mA. The exposure time was 3 s and\nthe measured angle, 2θ, was from 5 o to 45 deg. The scanning step was 0.02 deg.\n2.6. Surface Roughness\nRoughness of the surface samples was determined by the surface proﬁlometry tech-\nnique (Hommel Tester, T1500, Jenoptik, Jena, Germany). The surface roughness parameter\nRa, i.e., an average deviation of the linear proﬁle was determined from ﬁve line measure-\nments made on the surface of the samples.\n2.7. Raman Micro-Spectroscopy\nRaman spectroscopic measurements were taken by the Renishaw inVia spectrometer\n(Renishaw, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom) equipped with a Leica microscope. The\nspectra were obtained from ten different spatial positions of each material and then an\naverage spectrum for both the upper and lower surfaces of the membranes was obtained\nand used for calculation. A laser line of 785 nm was focused through a 50× magniﬁcation\nobjective. A diffraction grating with 1200 grooves/mm was used. The spectral range of\n2000–500 cm−1 was selected and the power of the laser was kept at the same level for all of\nthe probes (adequately low to prevent the samples’ destruction or disturbances). Renishaw,\nWiRE v. 2.0 and v. 3.4 software (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom) has been\nused to develop the spectra.\n",
    "J. Compos. Sci. 2021, 5, 20\n5 of 14\nThe spectral curve ﬁtting method was applied in order to evaluate the crystallinity\nparameters for the two components of nanomaterial: a poly (ε-caprolactone) matrix and\ncarbon nanoparticles. Therefore, the speciﬁc areas of the spectra where the characteristic\nfor these components bands appear, were chosen for analysis. The study of the PCL crys-\ntallinity was carried out in three different areas marked in the sample spectrum (Figure 2):\n1770–1700 cm−1, 1380–1200 cm−1, and 1150–1000 cm−1. To assess the crystallinity of the\ngraphene materials, the ratio of the integral intensities of the D1 band (approx. 1300 cm−1)\nto the G band (approx. 1600 cm−1), i.e., (ID1/IG), was calculated.\n \nFigure 2. An exemplary Raman spectrum with the marked three ranges selected for the analysis of\nthe crystallinity of the poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) matrix.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. The Morphology of the Samples\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed to analyze the\nmorphology of the samples studied, i.e., The synthetic graphite, and the graphite-derived\ngraphene phases and composite membranes. Figure 3 depicts the SEM micrographs of the\ninitial graphite grains (Figure 3A), GO and rGO (Figure 3B,C respectively). The morphology\nof these two graphene particles does not differ signiﬁcantly. For both samples the folded\nand wrinkled morphology can be observed. However, in the case of the rGO (Figure 3C) the\nindividual ﬂakes are separated by larger porous areas. These images show graphite-based\nnanocomponents prior to the deagglomeration process that precedes combining these\nmaterials with the polymer matrix described in Section 2.2.\n \nFigure 3.

Comparing the inﬂuence of\nthe graphene derivates on the structure of polymer, it can be assumed that rGO affects the\nPCL matrix more signiﬁcantly than GO, the surface is more wrinkled or is dispersed more\nefﬁciently than GO (Figure 4B,C).\nFigure 4. The SEM micrographs of: (A) the PCL reference membrane (B) the PCL/GO membrane and (C) the PCL/rGO mem-\nbrane.\n3.2. Contact Angle, Surface Roughness and SFE Measurements\nThe contact angle measurements that is the standard method for material testing,\nallow to calculate the level of hydrophobicity and surface free energies. The obtained\nvalues are presented in Table 1. The hydrophobicity of the top surface of PCL/GO is higher\nthan the reference PCL, however this difference is within the standard deviation range.\nWhen it comes to top face of the PCL/rGO membrane, the hydrophobicity went down\ncompare to the unmodiﬁed PCL. Generally, the hydrophobicity is lower for the bottom\nsurface of the composites than the upper ones. The surface free energy turned out to\ngo up as the polymeric matrix was modiﬁed by the graphene derivates. The depiction\nof the exemplary water contact angle measurements for nanocomposites is shown in\nFigure 5. A higher surface free energy of the bottom nanocomposite layer is observed,\nwhich indicates a greater density of carbon nanoparticles near the bottom surface. This is\nconﬁrmed by the results for the PCL reference membrane, for which the SFE top surface\nis higher than for the lower one, due to the crystallization conditions. The calculated\nSFE value of PCL/rGO top surface is greater than the PCL/GO, which is consistent with\ntheir morphology, Figure 4B,C. Increased surface energy is attributed to increased surface\nnano-roughness for PCL/rGO [23]. For this membrane, the greater polar component of\nenergy is noteworthy, Table 1. The differences in the Ra values occur mainly between both\nsurfaces of the samples (top, bottom). These differences may be due to the method of\npreparation the samples. The surface of the sample in contact with the glass surface (Petri\ndish) has slightly lower roughness.\nTable 1.

The Raman Micro-Spectroscopy Analysis\nRaman micro-spectroscopy is a method of choice for the analysis of carbon nanomate-\nrials since it is an effective method to characterize the details of short-range ordering. The\nRaman spectroscopy technique is a standard characterization tool that is widely used and\nis excellent for distinguishing between the bond type, internal stresses in amorphous and\nnanocrystalline carbon material and the size of ordered domains [24,25].\nThe average Raman spectra of the measured nanoparticles: the oxide graphene GO\nand the reduced oxide graphene rGO are presented in Figure 6. The characteristic G-\nband appears at around 1590 cm−1 and it is related to the presence of carbon materials.\nThe graphitic G-band is a result of the in-plane vibrations of the sp2 carbon networks\nand originates as a doubly degenerate phonon mode of E2g symmetry. The second most\nfrequently observed peak is the D1 disorder-induced band at ca. 1315 cm−1 originating\nfrom the out-of-plane vibrations caused by the presence of structural defects, curved\ngraphite sheets and lattice distortions in the carbon structures, and is absent with highly\ncrystalline graphitic materials. The half-width of this band is two times smaller for rGO than\nfor GO. Additionally the appearance of the 2D secondary band for rGO at wavenumber\n26,917 cm−1 may indicate that carbon nanosheets preserve the relatively isolated graphene\nstructure [26]. The graphene used for this study comes from the standard production. It\nwas decided that our research should be as close as possible to the practical conditions\nfor the production of nanocomposites because the samples used for the production of the\nmaterial must be available in large quantities but at the same time at reasonable price.\nFigure 6.

The PCL/GO in comparison to\nPCL/rGO, seems to exhibit a stronger resonance Raman effect or other quantum effects.\nAdditionally, the speciﬁc arrangement of nanoparticles may result from a more efﬁcient\ndispersion in the polymer due to the presence of oxygen-containing groups that can form\nbonds with the polymer and therefore, did not deagglomerate during the crystallization\nprocess.

The Curve Fitting Models and Crystallinity Parameters Assessment\nIn order to obtain more detailed information on the structure and crystallinity of\ngraphene nanoparticles and changes in these parameters in the nanocomposite membranes,\na Raman spectra analysis was performed. The standard procedure of peak ﬁtting was\nconducted, the mixed Gaussian/Lorenz peaks with linear background subtraction were\nemployed in every spectrum.\n3.4.1. The Graphene D/G Intensity Ratio\nIn order to assess the crystallinity level of the studied materials the ratio of intensi-\nties ID1/IG was calculated [30]. The three band model was adopted in the curve ﬁtting\nprocedure (Figure 8A): the mentioned before G-band (ca. 1590 cm−1), the D1-band (ca.\n1320 cm−1), and also the graphite D3 band resulting from the defects located outside the\nplane of the aromatic layers [31,32]. It is believed that the ID1/IG ratio reveals information\nabout the number of defects in the structure of carbon nanomaterials, and thus is a measure\nof their degree of organization [33].\nFigure 8. The Raman spectrum of GO sample in the 1900–1100 cm−1 range, with the model of\nﬁtting for the G-, D1- and D3-bands marked (A). The ID/IG intensity ratio of the bands of the tested\nmaterials (B).\nThe ID1/IG intensity ratios are presented in the Figure 8B, where a comparison of the\nupper and lower surfaces of the membranes is also presented. A higher ID/IG intensity\nratio for GO indicates that 2D graphene layer is substantially inhomogenous [34]. Although\nthe level of crystallinity for both the GO and rGO graphene materials is comparable, there\nare clear alterations in the crystallinity level of the graphene derivatives after their incor-\nporation into the polymeric matrix. For both types of nanoﬁllers the level of crystallinity\nincreases. The material is more structured in the case of PCL/rGO that can be connected\nwith the lower quantity of the oxide-containing groups in the rGO in comparison to the\nGO. However, it seems that the composites’ evaporation conditions during their manufac-\nturing did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ordering structure in the graphene phases that\nare incorporated into the polymeric matrix and then in the top surface of the membrane in\ncomparison to the bottom surface since the ratio ID1/IG barely shifted. What is even more\nremarkable, is that the ID1/IG parameter does not change its value in the rGO against to\nthe GO nanoparticles. Since, the degree of organisation is the same for the GO and the rGO,\nit can be concluded that the reduction process did not inﬂuence the quantity of the defects\nin the oxide graphene layers.\n",
    "J. Compos. Sci. 2021, 5, 20\n10 of 14\nDue to the inversive proportionality of the ID1/IG ratio to the size of the ordered\nnanocrystallite in the plane (La), the La parameters for the studied materials were evaluated.\nCalculations were performed by the employment of Equation (1) [35]. The obtained results\nare collected in Table 3.\nLa(nm) = (2.4 × 10−10) × λ4\nlaser × (ID1/IG)−1\n(1)\nTable 3.

However, for both graphene\nderivatives, the rGO and the GO, the size of the nano-crystallites increases as the result of\nthe incorporation of these nanoﬁllers into the polymer matrix. The La value increases for\nPCL/rGO by about 20 nm compared to PCL/GO. In both of the nanocomposite membranes,\nthe size of the nano-crystallites is slightly larger in the bottom surface. However, it is\nimportant to mention that some studies have reported that the proportional relationship\nbetween ID1/IG and crystallite size may not be valid in some cases (especially over the\n1.1 ID1/IG values) [35,36].\n3.4.2. Assessment of the Crystallinity of the PCL Matrix\nThe crystallinity parameters of the poly(ε-caprolactone) matrix and its changes after\nthe graphene GO and rGO particles incorporation were evaluated using the spectral curve\nﬁtting procedure, which was carried out for three spectral ranges: 1770–1700; 1380–1200;\n1150–1000 cm−1. The peak ﬁt models for the individual spectral ranges, and the obtained\nresults, are shown in Figure 9. The relatively high values of standard deviations, especially\nfor the PCL/GO membrane, indicate the heterogenous character of the nanocomposites.\nThis feature may be desirable in speciﬁc applications, particularly in those requiring the\nability of mimicking tissue environment by the material.\nThe integrated intensity ratio of I1722/I1735 informs about the crystallinity of the\npolymer C=O group domains (Figure 9A). For all of the three analysed materials a higher\ndegree of crystallinity is observed in the bottom surface of the membranes. There is\nonly a little difference of I1722/I1735 intensity ratio value between the reference PCL and\nPCL/rGO membrane, that reveals the decrease of crystallinity after the incorporation of\nrGO into the polymeric matrix, so the amorphousness rises. However, the pattern of the\nchanges signiﬁcantly differs in the case of PCL/GO. Here, the ratio I1722/I1735 increases\nin comparison to raw PCL, what supports the thesis that GO acts as a nucleation agent\nenhancing the crystallization of PCL [7].\nThe insight into to the changes of the ester part of the polymeric matrix gives the\nI1107/I1095 integrated ratio (Figure 9B). The top surfaces of the membranes show a higher\ncrystallinity level in comparison with the reference PCL and the PCL/rGO membranes,\nbut not for the PCL/GO. Generally, the amorphousness within the COC polymer domains\nincreases as a result of the nanoﬁllers’ incorporation.

The Raman spectra in the: (A) 1770–1700 cm−1; (B) 1380–1200 cm−1; (C) 1150–1000 cm−1 range; The curve ﬁtting\nmodels and integral intensity ratios of the chosen polymeric bands of the tested materials (the top surface of each material\nwas tested, 785 nm laser line).\nThe third analysed range 1380–1200 cm−1 delivers information about the aliphatic\nparts of the PCL chain (Figure 9C). The integrated intensity ratio I1285/I1305 shows a similar\npattern of changes to the shifts of ratio I1722/I1735. The crystallinity od aliphatic part of the\npolymer increases signiﬁcantly for PCL/GO, but slightly decreases in the case of PCL/rGO\n(compare to the raw PCL). The standard deviations are relatively low so the heterogeneity\nof the whole membranes has its origin in the polymer functional groups of heterogeneous\ncharacter. Again, the great increase of PCL/GO crystallinity conﬁrms that GO can act as\na nucleation agent enhancing the crystallization of PCL. What is more, it seems that the\nhydrophilic functional groups of GO and their polar-polar interaction with the polymeric\nmatrix play a clue role in this effect.\n3.5. X-ray Diffraction Analysis\nThe obtained diffraction patterns of the tested nanocomposite membranes are shown\nin Figure 10. The PCL polymer is semi-crystalline as evidenced by clearly shaped diffrac-\ntion maxima with the most pronounced for the 2 Theta 21.389 deg angle [37]. This max-\nimum moves a little in nanocomposites to 21.398 deg and to 21.435 deg for PCL/GO\nand PCL/rGO, respectively. Due to the relatively low content of carbon nanoadditives\nin nanocomposites (equal to 0.5 wt%) the pattern of the diffraction maxima of the PCL\nmatrix is dominant (Figure 10A). However, the increase in the intensity of this signiﬁcant\nmaximum of approx. 1.7 and 1.4 for PCL/GO and PCL/rGO, respectively, proves the\ninﬂuence of nanoadditives on the increase of the crystallinity of nanocomposite membranes.\nAdditionally, in both materials relatively wide maxima appear of about 13.10 deg, while in\nPCL/rGO there are also two broad bands at 10.50 degrees and 10.90 degrees (Figure 10B).\nThey signify the presence of oxygen functionalities [38,39].\n",

Conclusions\nThe Raman micro-spectroscopy technique turned out to be an inestimable tool for\nthe study of the interactions at the interface of the polymer and the graphene deriva-\ntives nanoparticles. PCL/GO and the PCL/rGO differ between each other in plenty of\naspects what was conﬁrmed by this study. Beside the similar characteristics of the studied\nnanoﬁllers such as the level of crystallinity/organisation and the in-plane size of the nano-\ncrystallites, they inﬂuenced polymeric matrix differently. In general, the incorporation of\nthe rGO particles into the polymer matrix did not inﬂuence the material structure as much\nas it did the GO particles. It was revealed that the level of crystallinity is generally higher\nin the PCL/GO membrane as compared to PCL/rGO (and even raw PCL) what conﬁrms\nthe conclusion that the GO acts as a nucleation agent enhancing the crystallization of PCL.\nBoth materials appear to be interesting options for future applications, especially in the\nﬁeld of bone regenerative medicine. However, further biocompatibility tests are necessary\nto conﬁrm their potential.\nAuthor Contributions: A.K., investigation, writing—original draft preparation; E.D.
