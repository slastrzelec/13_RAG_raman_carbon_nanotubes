Introduction and early history\nIn this review of the big picture of Raman Scattering in\ncarbon nanotubes, we emphasize both the evolution of this ﬁeld\nover its 10-year history and the important role that Brazilian\nscience has played in its evolution. Emphasis is given both to\nthe impact that nanotubes have had on the evolution of Raman\nspectroscopy in one-dimensional systems and the impact that\nRaman spectroscopy has had on the development of carbon\nnanotube science and sample characterization.\nSingle walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are unique in\nterms of their very small size ( \u0003 1 nm in diameter), their strong\none-dimensionality (1D), and the fact that a nanotube can be\neither semiconducting or metallic depending on the geometry\nwhich results from the rolling of the graphene sheet to form a\nSWNT as indicated in Fig. 1(a). Here we see the unusual\nelectronic structure of graphene which has a dispersion relation\nlinear in wave vector k about the K point in the Brillouin zone\n(Fig. 1(b)). The resulting conical constant energy surfaces of\nthe valence and conduction bands touch at the K point of the\nBrillouin zone through which the Fermi energy passes\n(Fig. 1(b)). Thus two-dimensional graphene is by symmetry\na zero-gap semiconductor. Since strong quantum conﬁnement\noccurs in the two directions perpendicular to the nanotube axis,\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/vibspec\nVibrational Spectroscopy 45 (2007) 71–81\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: Millie@mgm.mit.edu (M.S.

    "a quasi-continuum of states can only occur along the nanotube\naxis, resulting in the cutting lines shown in Fig. 1(c). These\ncutting lines are separated from one another by 2/ dt, where dt is\nthe nanotube diameter, and the orientation of the cutting lines\ndepends on the chiral angle u of each nanotube, where u is the\nangle between the chiral vector Ch ¼ nˆa1 þ mˆa2 and the ˆa1\nbasis vector of graphene. Thus every ðn; mÞ nanotube has a\nunique set of cutting lines resulting in a unique set of energy\nlevels EnðkÞ. If one of the cutting lines goes through the K point\n(Fig. 1(c)), then the SWNT is metallic with occupied states at\nthe K point. The characteristic van Hove singularities (vHSs)\nassociated with 1D systems are seen at the extremal point of\neach cutting line (Fig. 1(c)). If the SWNT is undoped, the Fermi\nlevel of the SWNT will then lie halfway between the highest\nlying vHS in the valence band and the lowest lying one in the\nconduction band. Furthermore, each ðn; mÞ SWNT will have a\nunique set of vHSs, corresponding to energies Ei with a very\nhigh density of electronic states (Fig. 1(c)). This density of\nstates can be probed experimentally, and in fact by the Raman\neffect. However the optical transitions for nanotubes are\nexcitonic and are strongly inﬂuenced by many body interac-\ntions, as discussed below.\nThe ﬁrst experimental study of the Raman effect in SWNTs\nstarted 10 years ago, when for the ﬁrst time a sufﬁcient supply of\nSWNTs became available through a breakthrough in the\nsynthesis process that occurred in Smalley’s group at Rice\nUniversity [1]. The Raman spectra thus obtained (see Fig. 2(b))\nshowed the two characteristic and unique signatures of carbon\nnanotubes [2]. The ﬁrst signature relates to the G-band arising\nfrom the optical vibration of two adjacent carbon atoms on the\nwall of the SWNT, which for semiconducting tubes shows a\ndoublet structure with a strong Gþpeak, associated with\nvibrations along the tube and identiﬁed with the LO (longitudinal\noptical) mode, and a weaker G\u0002 peak appearing at a little lower\nfrequency, associated with vibrations in the circumferential\ndirection and identiﬁed with the TO (transverse optical) mode,\nand softened by the curvature of the nanotube. The down-shift of\nvG\u0002 relative to vGþ is due to an admixture of a small amount of a\nlow frequency phonon mode normal to the graphene sheet. For\nmetallic tubes the Gþ mode is associated with the TO mode and\nthe LO mode lies at a lower frequency because of the strong\nelectron phonon interaction and the Kohn anomaly [3–5]. The\nsecond characteristic signature of a SWNT is the appearance of a\nstrong Raman feature at relatively low frequencies, associated\nwith the radial breathing mode (RBM) where all the carbon\natoms are vibrating in the radial direction in an A-symmetry\ntotally symmetric breathing mode pattern, unique to SWNTs.\nThe vibrational frequency vRBM was identiﬁed with a 1/ dt\ndiameter dependence [2], thus providing a method for\ncharacterizing the diameter distribution in the SWNT ensemble\nsamples available at that time. The strong dependence of the two\ncharacteristic Raman features on laser excitation energy Elaser\nwas interpreted in terms of a resonance Raman scattering (RRS)\nprocess discovered earlier by two Brazilian scientists (Leite and\nPorto) when they were working at Bell Labs in the US in their\nearly careers [6]. According to the RRS process, a strong Raman\nintensityisonly observed forthoseðn; mÞ tubeswith singularities\nin their joint density of states in resonance with Elaser. According\nto this RRS process, the laser energy Elaser selects only those\nðn; mÞ SWNTs with optical transition energies within the\nresonance window of Elaser, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). From\nthe relation between the radial breathing mode frequency vRBM\nand the tube diameter dt, it became clear that the Raman effect\ncould provide important information on the characterization of\nthe ðn; mÞ nanotube distribution contained within typical\nensemble samples.\nFig. 1.

    "The next breakthrough that occurred in the history of the\nRaman effect in carbon nanotubes came in 1998, through\nanother Brazilian, Marcos Pimenta, who when visiting MIT did\na systematic study of the Raman spectra in SWNT ensemble\nsamples, following up on the early work of Rao et al. [2] but\nnow using many more laser lines [7,8]. In his studies he noticed\nthat for the diameter distribution of his sample, the spectral\nlineshape was dependent on Elaser (see Fig. 3(a)), showing one\ntype of lineshape which he identiﬁed with semiconducting S-\nSWNTs, but for Elaser in the range between 1.83 and 2.14 eV, a\nvery different lineshape was identiﬁed and associated with\nmetallic M-SWNTs. From the Kataura plot shown in Fig. 3(b),\nwhere the resonant energies of all the Eii transition for every\nðn; mÞ nanotube are plotted in accordance with the RRS process\nindicated by Fig. 2(a) and a simple tight binding model for the\nelectronic structure of SWNTs, it became clear that when Elaser\nwas in resonance primarily with M-SWNTs, a different\nlineshape was observed than for S-SWNTs. This ﬁnding came\nat about the same time as it was shown experimentally using\nlow temperature scanning probe spectroscopy and scanning\ntunneling microscopy [9,10] that SWNTs could be either S-\nSWNTs or M-SWNTs depending on their nanotube ðn; mÞ\nchirality, as had been predicted previously [11,12]. Showing\nthat similar information could be obtained with Raman\nspectroscopy, a technique generally available to most experi-\nmental groups, was a signiﬁcant breakthrough at that time for\nmaking possible a much more detailed characterization of the\nðn; mÞ SWNTs contained within the SWNT ensemble (or rope)\nsamples that were available at that time.\n2. Single SWNT Raman spectroscopy\nThe second phase of advances in Raman spectroscopy\nrelates to the observation of spectra at the single nanotube level\n[13], as shown in Fig. 4. Here, examples of Raman spectra for\none individual metallic (upper trace) and one semiconducting\n(lower trace) SWNT are shown, as observed by another\nBrazilian [13], Ado Jorio, working in his early career at MIT.\nThe observation of spectra at the single nanotube level is\nenabled by the strong enhancement in intensity occurring\nbecause of the 1D nature of the electronic density of states, so\nthat the intensity of the RBM feature (see insets to Fig. 5 for the\ncarbon atom mode displacements) from one SWNT is\ncomparable to the signal coming from the many silicon atoms\nilluminated by the 1 mm light beam on the substrate (Fig. 4).\nFrom measurement of the RBM frequency and the resonant\nenergy of each ðn; mÞ tube, the Kataura plot (see Fig. 3(b))\nallowed identiﬁcation of the ðn; mÞ identity of individual tubes.\nThe determination of the resonant energy within the resonance\nwindow over which a given ðn; mÞ tube could be observed was\nenabled by analysis of the Stokes and anti-Stokes features of the\nRaman spectra carried out by another Brazilian doctoral\nstudent, Antonio G. Souza-Filho [14,15].\nHaving shown that Raman spectra at the single nanotube\nlevel could be observed, the properties of each of the features\nnormally observed in the Raman spectra of SWNTs (see\nFig. 5) could be explored as a function of diameter and chiral\nangle. Both ﬁrst-order Raman features, such as the RBM and\nthe G-band, and second order features, such as the D-band\nand G0-band (in Fig. 5), could be studied in this way. As an\nexample of ﬁrst-order G-band spectra, we show the spectra\nfor three semiconducting tubes (Fig. 6(a)) and for three\nmetallic tubes (Fig. 6(b)) [16], yielding the diameter\nFig. 2.

    "dependence of the G\u0002 feature shown in Fig. 6(c). The Gþ\nfeature was seen to have little diameter dependence. Line\nshapes at the individual tube level for S-SWNTs similar to\nthat of ensemble samples (Fig. 3) could be seen, while that\nfor M tubes showed a variety of lineshapes. Interestingly, the\nlineshape\nof\nM-SWNTs\nat\nthe\nsingle\nnanotube\nlevel\nremained an open issue for some time. It was not until\nseveral years later with the identiﬁcation of the Kohn\nanomaly [3–5] that this topic is being clariﬁed. For the S-\nSWNTs, polarization studies at the single nanotube level [17]\nidentiﬁed the detailed lineshape and the symmetries of the\nsix symmetry components contributing to the complex\nlineshape identiﬁed in the initial observation of Raman\nspectra for SWNTs [2]. Polarization studies of M-SWNTs\nare more complicated because of the dependence of the\nlineshapes of the spectra on chirality and laser energy\ndependence, and though they have been carried out over a\nperiod of time, such polarization studies still remain an area\nof active study. Furthermore, studies at the single nanotube\nlevel clariﬁed understanding of the Raman spectra of bundled\nsamples where contributions are observed from both metallic\nand semiconducting tubes and where perturbations due to\ninter-tube interactions are also observed.\nThe behavior of the second order D-band and G0-band\nfeatures were also clariﬁed by studies at the single nanotube\nlevel which illuminated the physical characteristics of these\nhighly dispersive features through the double resonance process\nwhich enables the G0-band to have such a strong intensity [18–\n22]. The large dispersion of the G0-band frequency with ELaser\nenabled study of the wave vector dependence of Raman\nfeatures, allowing analysis to be made of the trigonal\nFig. 3.

    "warping effect on the electronic structure of SWNTs [23](see\nFig. 7) and later of the trigonal warping effect of the phonon\nmodes, once further understanding was obtained of the\nconnection between cutting lines and the double resonance\nprocess [24,25]. Since the D-band and G0-band arise from\nhighly dispersive double resonance processes, the D-band and\nG0-band frequencies depend both on the tube diameter and on\nthe laser excitation energy which can be studied at the single\nnanotube level [26].\nAnother major impact of single nanotube spectroscopy is\non\nthe\nmetrology\nof\nnanotubes,\nallowing\na\ndetailed\nexamination of the physical properties of individual nano-\ntubes to be made by performing joint Raman experiments to\nidentify the chiral indices of a particular ðn; mÞ SWNT and\nthen to measure its physical properties, such as its transport I–\nV\ncharacteristics\nor\nits\nstrain\nbehavior\n[28–30].\nThe\nobservation of the Raman effect at the single nanotube level\ninspired exploration of other photo-physical effects that could\nalso be observed at the single nanotube level, and launched\nthe third phase of Raman spectroscopy studies in SWNTs\nwhich is discussed next.\n3. Excitonic interpretation of Raman spectra\nThe observation of the ﬂuorescent emission of light by\nSWNTs (wrapped in a surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate\n(SDS)) at energy E11 after excitation at E22 (see Fig. 8(b))\nushered in the third phase of the history of Raman\nspectroscopy in carbon nanotubes. Characteristic of this\nphase of Raman spectroscopy in SWNTs was the introduction\nof\nother\ncomplementary\nspectroscopies\nthat\ncould\nbe\nperformed at the single nanotube level and the discovery\nthat optical transitions in SWNTs are excitonic, and strongly\ndependent on many-body effects [31]. Photoluminescence\nspectroscopy (PL) has provided a complementary tool for the\nðn; mÞ chirality identiﬁcation of semiconducting SWNTs\n[32,33], as shown in Fig. 8. Here, only those isolated SWNTs\nthat are wrapped in a surfactant such as SDS can be in excited\nstates long enough to emit light before recombination occurs.\nIn the early PL studies, absorption occurred at ES\n22 and\nemission at ES\n11 (Fig. 8(b)).\nThe photoluminescence emission from SWNTs in solution\nis shown in Fig. 8(c) as a function of absorption excitation wave\nFig. 6.

    "lengths (which can also be expressed on an energy scale). When\nthe energies for these optical excitations are then plotted on a\nKataura plot, it is seen that the experimental points are arranged\naccording to family patterns mod((2n þ m), 3) and the ES\n22=ES\n11\ntransition energy ratios are not 2, as would be expected for an\nelectronic structure calculation based on the simple tight\nbinding model, but this ratio was rather found to be 1.8 (called\nthe ratio problem).\nFurthermore, the actual identiﬁcation of the chiral indices\nðn; mÞ by the RRS method and by the PL method did not seem to\nbe consistence with one another. To gain further insight into this\nproblem, RRS and PL measurements were made on the same\nSDS-wrapped SWNT sample [34]. Then the same Eii values\nwere obtained for the same ðn; mÞ tubes, thereby resolving this\nissue abouttheobservationoffamily effects inSWNTs. Theratio\nproblem on the other hand, presented unexplained fundamental\nphysics phenomena, whose resolution ultimately led to the\ninterpretation of the optical excitation process in SWNTs in\nterms of excitonic processes [31]. From another standpoint, the\nobservation of three-dimensional PL emission intensity maps\nversus ES\n22 absorption/ ES\n11 emission energy as in Fig. 8,\nstimulated the development of experimental Raman methods for\nusingmanylaserexcitationlinemapping,asshowninFig.9.This\nadvance enriched the development of RRS techniques for nano-\nsystems in studies of the Raman lineshape within the\nresonant window of SWNTs.

    "comparative lineshape studies such as that for freely suspended\nnanotubes and those sitting on substrates (Fig. 10).\nFrom a more fundamental standpoint the joint RRS and\nRaman studies led to the development of the extended tight\nbinding model, which included consideration of SWNT curva-\nture effects, long-range C–C bonding interactions, and geome-\ntrical structure optimization [36,37]. With the extended tight\nbindingmodel,the photo-physicalpropertiesofSWNTscouldbe\nmore effectively explored in studying phenomena such as strain\neffects in carbon nanotubes [30], studying double walled carbon\nnanotube (DWNT) spectroscopy [38], the role of linear carbon\nchains in DWNT coalescence [39], and a comparative study of\nbromine intercalation of graphite and of DWNT bundles [38].\n4. Current Raman studies and future outlook\nAs we look into the start of the second decade of the use of\nRaman spectroscopy to study carbon nanotubes, we see the\nsame two trends of the ﬁrst decade still remaining in sharp\nfocus, but also with some new emphasis. The two continuing\nthemes include new fundamental studies in the Raman\nspectroscopy of 1D systems as well as advances in the\ncharacterization of carbon nanotubes, which we illustrate below\nwith several examples.\nTo study the comparative intercalation of graphite and\nDWNT bundles, bromine was at ﬁrst selected for the\nintercalant, because it allowed investigation of the effect of\nintercalation on both the bromine guest and the DWNT host\nspecies. The inset to Fig. 11 shows the structural effect of\nbromine doping on DWNTs, indicating that intercalation\npreserves the structural integrity of the DWNTs, and suggesting\nthat the bromine intercalant enters between the outer walls of\nthe DWNTs [38] in much the same way that it goes between\nadjacent graphene layers in graphite intercalation compounds\nFig. 8.

    "[40]. The effect of intercalation on the bromine breathing mode\ncan be seen in Fig. 11 where a new feature is seen in the Raman\nspectra taken at Elaser ¼ 2:33 eV of bromine-intercalated\nDWNTs where a strong feature is seen at 233 cm\u00021 in\nintercalated DWNTs, but is not seen in unintercalated DWNTs.\nThe observed frequency for the Br–Br stretch mode is\nconsistent with theoretical density functional calculations\nwithin the local density approximation [41]. This Br–Br\nvibrational mode is resonant in the spectra near 2.33 eV, and the\nbromine diatomic breathing mode peak is downshifted by\n91 cm\u00021relative to its counterpart in the gas phase. On the other\nhand, the RBM of the outer semiconducting tube does not shift in\nfrequency with bromine intercalation but the RBM of the inner\nmetallic tube downshifts in frequency and decreases in intensity\nwith 2.33 eV excitation, as can be seen in Fig. 12 showing\nbromine intercalated DWNT bundle subjected to a heating and\ncooling cycle. Unlike the situation in graphite intercalation\ncompounds (GICs) where it is difﬁcult to completely drive out\nthe bromine [40], heating of the Br2-DWNT sample to 150\u0004 C is\nFig. 10.

Consistent results were also obtained by\nBarros, a Brazilian graduate student working on the H2SO4–\nDWNT system [42].\nThe use of Raman spectroscopy for the characterization and\nmetrology of SWNTs has also been advanced recently. An\nexample of this research direction of the ﬁeld is the ﬁnal topic\nof this big picture overview which relates to a study of the D-\nband in the Raman spectra of SWNTs. This feature has been\nused from the beginning of time [2] to evaluate the amount of\ndisorder in a SWNT sample. A major advance in this\ncharacterization of carbon nanotubes occurred with recent\nﬁndings by a Brazilian group [43], that the laser energy\ndependence of the D-band in graphite could be expressed in\nterms of a universal relation LaðnmÞ ¼ ð560=E4\nlaserÞðID=IGÞ\u00021.\nAn extension of these ideas was subsequently made by\nstudying the dependence of the normalized D-band intensity of\nSWNTs on nanotube length [44]. In this work it was shown that\nwhen the tube length Ltube becomes less than about 100 nm\n(corresponding to less than half the wavelength l of the laser\nexcitation), then the ratio ID=IG starts to show an increase with\ndecreasing Ltube, obeying a dependence of ID=IG \u0003 1=Ltube, as if\nLtube played the role of a mean free path of SWNT carriers, a role\nsimilar to that played by the in-plane structural coherence\ndistance La in graphite. In this work [44] the SWNT length\ndependence of ID=IG was measured on four samples. The ﬁrst\nwas a control sample (called as-grown) showing the same\ndiameter distribution as the other three samples, but having a\nnormal length distribution (greater than l=2), while the three\nshort samples had lengths Ltube of 100 nm, 70 nm and 50 nm.\nFig.14showsthatthe D-bandintensityat647 nmlaserexcitation\n(Elaser ¼ 1:917 eV) for the three short samples increased as Ltube\ndecreased, and Fig. 15 showed that ID=IG follows a 1/ Ltube\ndependence for four different laser excitation energies. From\nthese results we conclude that: (1) Ltube plays the role of a\nsymmetry-breaking perturbation (similar to La) for sufﬁciently\nshort tubes), (2) normal scattering processes are dominant for\ntubeslonger orequalto100 nm, (3) Ltube playsa role similar toLa\nin inducing disorder in the Raman scattering process for short\nFig. 13. (a) For Elaser ¼ 1:58 eV, the RBM features for individual tubes can be identiﬁed and monitored as the Br2dopant is added. (b) For 1.96 eV, a 7 cm\u00021up-shift\nin the Gþ peak is found upon bromine addition (acceptor doping [38]).\nFig. 14. Raman spectra are shown for four samples with tubes of different\nlengths. A zoom of the spectrum between 500 and 1500 cm\u00021 highlights the\nincrease in the D-band intensity as the tube length decreases [44].\nM.S.

    "tubes, (4) M tubes (in resonance with Elaser ¼ 2:3 eV) showed a\nmuch larger ID=IG ratio than S tubes (in resonance with the other\nElaser\nexcitation energies). Curiously M-SWNTs show a\ndependence of ID=IG on Elaser consistent with that of graphite,\nmeriting further study, (5) S-SWNTs consistently show a weaker\nD-band feature, for the same Ltube distribution and sample\npreparation method, also meriting further investigation.\n5. Outlook\nThis study on short SWNTs is part of recent interest in\ndeveloping a metrology science for nanotubes, whereby RRS\nwould become one of the major characterization techniques to be\nused for the speciﬁcation of SWNT samples that would even-\ntually be used in the market place for supplying SWNTs\ncommercially and in large scale for speciﬁc applications. This\ndeveloping interest in metrology is part of a growing trend of\nincreasing numbers of new entrants to the nanotube R&D ﬁeld\ncoming from the applications sector. Interest in nanotube metro-\nlogy also comes from researchers focused on SWNT synthesis\nscale-up strategies. To address these trends, the Brazilian nano-\ntube metrology efforts are now assuming a leadership position by\nsponsoring a satellite conference on nanotube metrology in Rio\nde Janeiro in June 2007 in connection with the upcoming inter-\nnational congress to be held in Ouro Preto, Brazil in June 2007.\nIn looking toward the large role that Brazilian science has\nbeen playing in the area of Raman spectroscopy of carbon\nnanotubes over the history of the subject, it seemed appropriate\nto open the international workshop on Raman spectroscopy in\nFortaleza, Brazil (September, 2006) with a big picture overview\nof Raman spectroscopy for the past decade with a view toward\nnew developments expected in the next decade both in\nfundamental scientiﬁc studies which are emphasized at the\nFortaleza conference but also on practical aspects which are\nlikely to become of increasing importance worldwide in the\nfuture if the nanotube ﬁeld is going to achieve its full potential\nin the commercial sector in service to societal needs.\nAcknowledgements\nThe MIT authors acknowledge support under NSF Grant\nDMR 04-05538.\nReferences\n[1] A.
