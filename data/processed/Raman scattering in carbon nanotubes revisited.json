    "Raman scattering in carbon nanotubes revisited\nJ. Maultzsch, S. Reich, and C. Thomsen\nInstitut fu¨r Festko¨rperphysik, Technische Universita¨t Berlin, Hardenbergstr. 36, 10623 Berlin, Germany\n~Received 14 March 2002; published 23 May 2002!\nWe explain the origin of the high-energy mode in the ﬁrst-order Raman spectra of single-walled carbon\nnanotubes by double-resonant scattering. Following this interpretation, we calculate the multiple-peak structure\nas found in Raman experiments. The highest peak is above the graphite G-point frequency; its amplitude is\nlarger than that of the second peak. We derive positive and negative frequency shifts as a function of excitation\nenergy, which we observe experimentally as well. We predict a difference in frequency and shape of the\nhigh-energy mode in Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.65.233402\nPACS number~s!: 78.30.Na, 63.22.1m, 71.20.Tx\nRaman spectroscopy is widely used to investigate both\nvibrational and electronic properties of solids. Because of the\nsmall wave vector transfer in ﬁrst-order scattering, only pho-\nnon modes with a nearly zero wave vector are expected in\nﬁrst-order Raman spectra. In particular, two of the three\ncharacteristic peaks in the ﬁrst-order spectra of carbon nano-\ntubes, the radial breathing mode at '200 cm21 ~Refs. 1 and\n2! and the high-energy graphitelike mode at '1600 cm21,\nhave so far been implicitly assumed to be G-point modes.\nMost conclusions derived from Raman experiments are\nbased on the G-point nature of these modes, e.g., an experi-\nmental determination of the tube diameter, chirality, and sin-\ngularities in the electronic density of states.3–5 On the other\nhand, a completely different interpretation has been estab-\nlished for the defect-induced D mode at '1350 cm21.\nSimilar to graphite, the D mode originates from a double-\nresonant Raman process involving phonon wave vectors cor-\nresponding roughly to the K point in graphite.6,7 This inter-\npretation leads to the question of whether the high-energy\nRaman spectrum in carbon nanotubes is also dominated by\nprocesses that allow phonon wave vectors throughout the\nwhole Brillouin zone.\nIn contrast to graphite, the experimental high-energy\nmode structure in carbon nanotubes consists of several peaks\nof different amplitude, the two most intense being separated\nby '20 cm21. This peculiar peak structure is not only\nfound in bundled nanotubes but also in measurements on\nindividual tubes.8,9 In spite of intensive research, the double-\npeak structure of the high-energy mode has not been under-\nstood. Some authors suggested that the different high-energy\nmode peaks correspond to G-point vibrations with different\nsymmetries (A1(g) , E1(g) , and E2(g) , where the subscript g\nrefers to armchair and zigzag tubes!.10,11 This is contradicted\nby polarization-dependent Raman measurements, which\nshow that the A1(g) phonon modes contribute most to the\nRaman spectra of nanotubes.8,12,13 Taking this into account, it\nwas suggested that the two most intense peaks correspond to\nzone-center longitudinal ~LO! and transversal ~TO! optical\nphonon modes with their frequency separation caused by dif-\nferent force constants along and perpendicular to the tube\naxis.12,14 However, this explanation is questionable: First,\nthere is no reason for the large splitting (20 cm21) between\nTO and LO modes in general chiral tubes, as the phonon\nmodes do not have any more purely longitudinal and trans-\nversal character.15 Only in achiral tubes are the LO- and\nTO-phonon modes distinguished, but one of them is forbid-\nden by symmetry. Second, in hydrostatic pressure measure-\nments, TO and LO modes in the uniaxial system should ex-\nhibit different pressure derivatives, contrary to what is\nobserved experimentally.16,17 All attempts for understanding\nthe high-energy modes in carbon nanotubes attribute the ob-\nserved Raman peaks to G-point vibrations that correspond to\nthe optical phonon modes of E2g symmetry in graphite.\nIn this paper we propose what we believe is a conception-\nally different explanation for the high-energy modes, which\nresolves the present discrepancies in the understanding of the\nRaman spectra. Our basic idea is that the high-energy peaks\nof carbon nanotubes do not correspond to a phonon mode\nwith a wave vector q'0, but instead originate from a\ndouble-resonance process with phonon wave vectors q.0.\nThe high-energy double-peak structure in general chiral\ntubes is caused by the two optical phonon branches of A1\nsymmetry at the G point. Our results do not crucially depend\non a splitting at the zone center in contrast to theories which\nare based on the difference between the so-called LO and TO\nG-point modes. Resonant scattering within different elec-\ntronic bands leads to additional peaks in the high-energy\nrange. In the double-resonance model the high-energy peaks\nin individual tubes are predicted to shift slightly with excita-\ntion energy. We prove our model by showing experimentally\npositive and negative excitation-energy-dependent shifts of\nthe high-energy frequencies in bundled single-walled nano-\ntubes. In the range of Elaser from 2.18 to 3.52 eV, the fre-\nquency shift has a different sign for the two largest peaks.\nA Raman process is doubly resonant if two of the transi-\ntions in the scattering process are real. This condition can\nalways be fulﬁlled in higher-order scattering with large pho-\nnon wave vectors. The apparent breaking of wave-vector\nconservation might, e.g., be due to impurities or other imper-\nfections in the lattice, a small size of the scattering crystal, or\na high optical absorption.18 The D mode in the Raman spec-\ntra of both graphite and single-walled carbon nanotubes\noriginates from such defect-induced, double-resonant Raman\nscattering.6,7 In Fig. 1 we show the electronic band structure\nof the (11,11) tube with three double-resonant scattering\nprocesses. In our example, the incoming photon is absorbed\nin a resonant transition near the conduction-band minimum,\nand the excited electron is resonantly scattered within the\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B, VOLUME 65, 233402\n0163-1829/2002/65~23!/233402~4!/$20.00\n©2002 The American Physical Society\n65 233402-1\n",
    "same electronic band. The other two steps of the resonant\nprocess, scattering of the electron by a defect and recombi-\nnation of the electron-hole pair, are not shown in Fig. 1.6\nResonant scattering of the excited electron across the G point\n~dashed arrow! leads to the D mode in the Raman spectra.7\nThe second possibility for a real transition of the excited\nelectron is scattering across the conduction-band minimum\n~solid arrows!. We ﬁnd that this process contributes to the\nRaman spectra as well and leads to the high-energy modes of\ncarbon nanotubes. The phonon mode involved here possesses\na small wave vector ~as compared to the D-mode process,\nbut large compared to the wave vector of light! and hence a\nfrequency near the G-point frequency. Two optical branches\nresult in two high-energy Raman peaks. Consequently, we\nexpect that the radial breathing mode also originates from the\nsame double-resonant process. At a given excitation energy,\nthe wave vector and frequency of the phonon depend on the\nparticular electronic band in which the electron is resonantly\nscattered. For example, in process A ~Fig. 1! the phonon\nwave vector q for resonant scattering is larger than in process\nB. These two transitions yield Raman peaks at different fre-\nquencies. Similar to the D-mode in nanotubes and graphite,\nthe double-resonance condition changes with the laser wave-\nlength. The electron wave vector at which the incoming ~or\noutgoing! resonance occurs and the phonon wave vector for\nthe second resonance depend on the excitation energy. As is\nobvious from Fig. 1, with increasing laser energy the phonon\nwave vector fulﬁlling the double-resonance condition be-\ncomes larger. The frequency of the Raman peaks then shifts\nwith excitation energy according to the dispersion of the\nphonon branches near the G point.\nWe explicitly calculated the high-energy Raman spectra\nof single-walled carbon nanotubes from the cross section for\ndefect-induced, double-resonant Raman scattering.18,7 We\nchose the incoming and outgoing light to be polarized paral-\nlel to the tube axis. We obtained the electron dispersion by\nthe symmetry-based tight-binding approximation with an\noverlap integral g052.9 eV.19 For the phonon dispersion we\nused a model dispersion adapted from graphite; see inset of\nFig. 2.20 The phonon branches were degenerate at the G\npoint; a splitting does not essentially alter our results. As a\nﬁrst approximation, we assume the phonon dispersion near\nthe G point ~for qP@0,p/a0#, where a0 is the length of the\ngraphite lattice vectors! to be independent of the tube chiral-\nity. Our samples in Raman scattering were single-walled\nnanotubes with a mean diameter of 1.45 nm. The tubes were\nexcited with an Ar1Kr1 laser; the light was dispersed by a\ntriple monochromator, and detected with a charge-coupled\ndevice.\nIn Fig. 2 we show our experimental high-energy Raman\nspectra and the calculation for the (15,6) tube. Double-\nresonant Raman scattering describes the essential features of\nthe measured spectra surprisingly well. In particular, we ﬁnd\nthe strongest peak at 1597 cm21 above the G point fre-\nquency (1588 cm21 in our dispersion, like in graphite! and\na second, less intense peak at 1575 cm21. The magnitude of\nthe splitting '20 cm21 as well as the absolute peak posi-\ntions are in excellent agreement with experiments. The rela-\ntive amplitude of the two peaks is also similar to the ratio\nfound in the experimental spectra. The crucial point, when\ncomparing the spectra at different excitation energies, is that\nthe Raman peaks shift both in experiment and in our calcu-\nlation, as predicted. The experimental frequency of the upper\npeak increases (3.5 cm21/eV), whereas the frequency of the\nlower peak decreases with increasing excitation energy\n(21.7 cm21/eV). Within our model, the frequency shift\nand the relative position of the peaks follow ~in this range of\nlaser wavelength and for this tube! from the phonon disper-\nsion. Because of the weak overbending in the upper phonon\nbranch ~see the inset of Fig. 2!, the Raman peak at\n1597 cm21 is at higher frequency than the G point fre-\nquency. The overbending leads to a positive shift with exci-\ntation energy of the peak at 1597 cm21; accordingly the\npeak at 1575 cm21 shifts to lower frequency with increasing\nFIG. 1.

    "laser energy. Because of the overbending, the phonon density\nof states near the G point is particularly large for the upper\nbranch. Therefore, the intensity of the upper peak is higher\nthan the intensity of the lower one, as found experimentally.\nIn the spectra calculated for 2.54 and 2.66 eV, the peak at\n1560 cm21 appears to split. In fact, a double-peak structure\nis expected for both peaks at each laser energy, because in\nthe (15,6) tube two electronic bands dominate the spectra.\nThe double-resonant process occurs for both bands at\nslightly different phonon wave vectors. Because the bands\nare rather close at their minimum, the different contributions\nto the Raman signal are only resolved at higher laser ener-\ngies.\nSo far we have discussed excitation energies involving the\nsame electronic bands. The phonon wave vector in such a\ndouble-resonance process continuously increases with in-\ncreasing laser energy. The excitation-energy dependence of\nthe peaks then reﬂects only the phonon dispersion near the G\npoint. For even larger laser energies, the next higher optical\ntransition can be reached, which again occurs close to the\nband minimum. The corresponding double-resonant phonon\nwave vectors are small; the Raman frequencies are expected\nquite close to the G-point frequencies. These contributions\ndominate the spectra because of the high density of elec-\ntronic states near the conduction band minimum, an effect\nwhich was also seen in the calculated D-mode intensity.7 In\nFig. 3 we show the excitation-energy dependence of the\nhigh-energy modes for laser energies up to 3.52 eV. The\nexperimental and calculated Raman frequencies are given by\nopen and closed symbols, respectively. It is clearly seen that\nthe continuous shift of the peaks is interrupted at Elaser\n53 eV. Above, the Raman signal originates from a scatter-\ning process close to the minimum of the next higher conduc-\ntion band. We calculated the high-energy Raman spectra for\nseveral chiral tubes with diameters of '1.4 nm and ob-\ntained results similar to those for the (15,6) tube. The peaks\nof different tubes are at different frequencies, which leads to\na broadening of the peaks in bulk samples compared with\nindividual tubes. When averaging over several tubes, we\nfound the frequency shift of the highest peak to differ only\nslightly from that of the single tube. The frequencies of the\nlower peaks scatter within a broader range leading to a re-\nduced average frequency shift.21 The laser energy at which\nthe next electronic band is reached is in general different for\nsemiconducting and metallic tubes. When the laser energy\nmatches the van Hove singularities in the joint density of\nstates, the Raman intensity is particularly large, and the cal-\nculated line shapes resemble those of metallic spectra. The\nspectra of bulk samples are thus determined by a convolution\nof the electronic density of states and the double-resonant\nprocess.\nFor the D mode in graphite and carbon nanotubes a dif-\nference between the frequencies in Stokes and anti-Stokes\nRaman spectra followed from the double-resonance model. A\nsimilar behavior is expected for the high-energy modes, be-\ncause the double-resonant phonon wave vector is larger in\nanti-Stokes scattering than in Stokes scattering. Then the po-\nsition of the peak at '1575 cm21 will be at lower fre-\nquency in anti-Stokes scattering than in Stokes scattering. In\ncontrast, the difference between Stokes and anti-Stokes spec-\ntra for the 1597-cm21 peak is sensitive to the overbending in\nthe phonon dispersion. Depending on the phonon wave vec-\ntor at which the maximum frequency occurs, the upper peak\nis at higher or lower frequency in anti-Stokes spectra. With\nincreasing excitation energy, in anti-Stokes scattering the\nnext optical transition is reached with an outgoing resonance\nat smaller laser energy than in Stokes scattering. Therefore,\nthe two high-energy peaks might be well separated in Stokes\nscattering ~as in Fig. 2!, but close together and broad in anti-\nStokes scattering at the same excitation energy. Anti-Stokes\nRaman spectra have so far been reported only for bulk\nsamples.22,23 For particular laser energies these experiments\nindeed show Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra quite different in\nshape. As a consequence of double-resonant Raman scatter-\ning, also we predict a similar behavior for individual nano-\ntubes.\nThe relative intensities of the D mode and the high-energy\nmode in ﬁrst-order scattering are, in contrast to graphite, not\ndetermined by the number of defects but by the chirality of\nthe tube. This is supported by experiments on isolated tubes,\nwhich show a strong variation of the intensity ratio when\ninvestigating different tubes.8,9\nCorresponding to the high-energy mode, the radial breath-\ning mode is also expected to originate from a double-\nresonant Raman process. On the other hand, the slope of the\ndispersion of the radial breathing mode is nearly zero close\nto the G point; thus the excitation-energy dependence of the\nRaman frequency is predicted to be small.\nIn conclusion, we showed that the high-energy modes in\nthe Raman spectra of carbon nanotubes originate from a\ndefect-induced, double-resonant Raman process revising the\norigin of these modes. The Raman peaks do not originate\nfrom the G-point vibrations, as is usual in ﬁrst-order scatter-\ning, but from phonons with large wave vectors. This explains\nwhy the largest high-energy peak in the Raman spectra oc-\ncurs at higher frequency than the G-point mode in graphite.\nFIG. 3.
