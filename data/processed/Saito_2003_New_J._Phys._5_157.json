    "157.2\nDEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n1. Introduction\nCarbon nanotubes have become a standard material in nanotechnology and a wide variety of\napplications using nanotubes have been proposed and investigated intensively (see this special\nissue, and also [1]). One of the most important subjects for nanotube technology is to evaluate\nnanotubes in a simple and quick way. In fact, we need to evaluate samples regarding the\nfollowing points: (a) the purity of nanotubes, (b) diameter and chirality, (c) whether metallic\nor semiconducting, (d) whether a perfect or defective crystal. Raman spectroscopy is a non-\ndestructive, non-dissipative measurement which is made at room temperature and at ambient\npressure. In particular, resonance Raman spectroscopy can select a few nanotubes in the\nnanotube sample which are resonant with the excitation laser energy. Thus we can observe the\nproperties of a nanotube by resonance Raman spectroscopy even for a bundle of nanotubes.\nA detailed description of the use of this technique for evaluating the above points is given in\nthe paper by Jorio et al [2]. In the present paper we focus our attention on the so-called double\nresonance Raman spectroscopy.\nIn the following section, we give the general ideas behind resonance Raman spectroscopy\nand of the double resonance Raman process. Then we review the topic of double resonance\nRaman spectroscopy of graphite and carbon nanotubes.\n2. General idea of resonance Raman spectroscopy\nFirst we give the basic idea of resonance Raman spectroscopy [3, 4] for general readers. For\na photo-excited electron, it will experience some processes before recombining with a hole in\nthe valence energy band. One of these processes is a scattering process by a quantized lattice\nvibration known as a phonon with the phonon wave vector q. The electronic wave vector k\nis scattered to k −q (phonon emission) or k + q (absorption), respectively, and the electron\nenergy is shifted downward or upward by h¯ωq, which is given by observation of the scattered\nlight and is known as the Stokes or anti-Stokes Raman shift. If a one-phonon scattering event\noccurs, it is called a ﬁrst-order Raman process. If either the initial k or the scattered k ± q\nelectronic states is a real electronic state, the scattering amplitude is enhanced, and this is\nknown as the initial or scattered resonance Raman process, respectively (see ﬁgure 1(a1, a2)).\nThis resonance enhancement is understood by quantum mechanical perturbation theory, where\nthe energy difference denominator for the scattering amplitude becomes zero.\nOne important aspect of the Raman process in a crystal is that the photo-excited electron\nhas to go back to its original k state to recombine with the hole at the k state. Because of\nthis restriction, only a q ∼0 phonon wave vector is selected in the ﬁrst-order Raman process.\nThus, in standard solid state textbooks, we see the statement that only the phonon energy at the\ncentre (\u0002 point) of Brillouin zone, which is called the zone-centre phonon mode, is observed\nby Raman spectroscopy for solids.\nWe also expect second-order Raman processes to occur (ﬁgure 1(c1, c2)), by emitting (1)\ntwo phonons with the same frequency or (2) two phonons with different frequencies, which\nare called overtone or combination Raman modes, respectively. Another second-order process\nis given by one-phonon scattering and one elastic scattering process (ﬁgure 1(b1–b4)). Elastic\nscattering occurs in the presence of a defect in the crystal. In the latter case, the one-phonon\nenergy is observed in the second-order process. Hereafter, we deﬁne the latter case also as a\nkind of second-order Raman process and we specify it as a one-phonon, second-order process.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 157.1–157.15 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

Top\npanels: incident photon resonance; bottom panels: scattered resonance conditions.\nFor one-phonon, second-order transitions, one of the two scattering events is\nelastic scattering (dashed line). Resonance points are shown as solid circles. See\nthe text for details.\nIn a second-order process, since an electron is represented by wave vectors q and −q,\nrespectively, by scattering from and then by back-scattering to the original k state, non-zone-\ncentre phonon modes (q ̸= 0) can be observed in the second-order Raman spectra. That is, (1)\nthe electron is excited at k, (2) scattered to k + q, (3) scattered back to k and (4) recombined\nwith a hole at k (see ﬁgure 1(b1–b4) and (c1, c2)). However, the probability for an electron to\nbe scattered by a phonon (the Raman cross section) is generally small, and thus the probability\nfor the event occurring twice in a second-order process is much smaller. Moreover, since\nq values can be arbitrary in the second-order process, the Raman spectra for the second-\norder Raman process generally becomes broad in the case of a crystal. Thus higher-order\nRaman processes in solids have not been considered much except for double resonance Raman\nspectroscopy [3].\nIn a double resonance process, the resonance enhancement results in Raman intensities\nthat are almost of the same order as in the ﬁrst-order resonance Raman spectra [4], and\nthe corresponding q is selected by the resonance condition. For a one-phonon second-order\nprocess, we can expect four different double resonance Raman processes, as shown in\nﬁgure 1(b1–b4). When we measure the electron energy from that of the valence band at k, the\nfour resonant conditions of ﬁgure 1(b1–b4) can be expressed, respectively, by\n(b1) Ei(k) = Elaser, E(k + q) = Ei(k) −h¯ωph(q), Ef(k) = E(k + q),\n(b2) Ei(k) = Elaser, E(k + q) = Ei(k), Ef(k) = E(k + q) −h¯ωph(−q), and\n(b3) Ei(k) = Elaser, E(k + q) = Ei(k) −h¯ωph(q), Ef(k) = E(k + q),\n(b4) Ei(k) = Elaser, E(k + q) = Ei(k), Ef(k) = E(k + q) −h¯ωph(−q).\nIn the above set of equations, the bold face letters imply the existence of a real electronic\nstate. In the case of graphite, these four processes will give two different phonon frequencies\nin the D band which will be shown in the next section. In the anti-Stokes process, we simply\nconsider the time-reversal counterpart of the corresponding Stokes process, and thus we have\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 157.1–157.15 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

For a two-phonon Stokes process, such as the G′\nband, the elastic scattering process denoted by a dashed line in ﬁgure 1(b1–b4) is changed\nto an inelastic phonon emission process. Then, only the cases (c1) and (c2) of ﬁgure 1 are\npossible for two-phonon double resonance processes.\nFor the one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotube, the k and q vectors are quantized along\nthe circumferential direction so that the values of k and q are selected with more stringent\nconditions [5, 6]. This is the reason why we observe sharp double resonance Raman peaks\nin carbon nanotubes. In fact, the line width of the D band of an SWNT is much smaller (as\nlow as 7 cm−1) than that for graphite (∼50 cm−1). Because of the van Hove singularity in the\njoint density of states (JDOS), we expect an additional, signiﬁcant enhancement of the Raman\nintensity [7].\nIn the following we will consider each of the important cases of the double resonance\nRaman spectra of graphite and nanotubes.\n3. D and G′ bands of graphite\nD- and G′-band features are observed in the Raman spectra of graphite material\nat around 1355 and 2700 cm−1, respectively for a laser excitation energy Elaser = 2.41 eV [7],\n[10]–[13]. Neither of them are group-theory predicted, as ﬁrst-order Raman spectra [14, 15].\nIn ﬁgure 2, we show typical D and G′ band Raman spectra of single wall carbon nanotubes\n(SWNTs) in metallic (top) and semiconducting (bottom) nanotubes.

Since the frequency of the G′ band is close to twice that of the\nD-band frequency, the G′ band is an overtone mode of the D band. Although the D and G′\nbands have been observed for more than 20 years, no clear explanation for the physical origin\nwas available until the recent work on double resonance theory [7, 13, 16].\nThe D and G′ bands show several unique Raman features.\nFeature 1. The D- and G′-band frequency increases with increasing laser excitation energy,\nElaser, in the visible light energy range. The values of the slope of the frequency with\nincreasing laser energy are ∂ωD/∂Elaser = 53 cm−1 eV−1 and ∂ωG′/∂Elaser = 106 cm−1 eV−1 for\nthe D and G′ bands, respectively [17]–[20].\nFeature 2. The D-band Raman intensity is large comparable to that of the ﬁrst-order Raman G\nband when the sample has a large number of defects, while the G′ band always shows a large\nintensity comparable to the G band without defects. Thus the D-band Raman intensity relative\nto the G-band intensity provides a good index for showing the presence of defects in graphite\nmaterials [18, 19], [21]–[23].\nFeature 3. The G′-band frequency is not exactly twice that of the D-band frequency. The\nStokes and anti-Stokes Raman frequencies of the D (or G′) band are not exactly the same [25].\nThe D- and G′-band features are explained, respectively, by one-phonon and two-phonon,\nsecond-order Raman scattering processes using double resonance theory [7, 13, 16].\nIn 2D graphite, the optical transition occurs around the K point (the corners of the\nhexagonal Brillouin zone (BZ) (see ﬁgure 3)) where the bonding and anti-bonding π bands\ntouch each other [14]. The bonding and anti-bonding electronic π bands show a linear k\ndispersion relation around the K point within the ﬁrst approximation, as is already shown in\nﬁgure 1,\nE(k) = ±\n√\n3\n2 γ0ka,\n(1)\nwhere the electronic k vectors are measured from the K point, a =\n√\n3aC–C = 2.46 Å and γ0 =\n2.89 eV [14]. Thus when Elaser increases, the electron k vectors and the corresponding phonon\nq vectors both increase.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 157.1–157.15 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

Possible q state for (a) intra-valley and (b) inter-valley scattering from\nk to k + q states around K and K′ points. When we start at q vector from the \u0002\npoint, the ﬁnal q states are circles rotating around the (a) \u0002 point and (b) K (or K′)\npoint. The density of states for q is singular at q ∼2k (dashed circles) and q ∼0\nmeasured from the (a) \u0002 and (b) K points [25].\nIn ﬁgure 3, we show the energy contours of E = Ei(k), E(k + q) and Ef(k) as solid\ncircles around the K or K′ points for the initial and intermediate states. The circle for Ef(k)\n(or E(k + q) in the cases of (b1) and (b3) in ﬁgure 1) is slightly smaller by the phonon energy\nthan that for Ei(k). Here there are two possibilities for selecting the phonon q vectors which\nsatisfy the double resonance condition, as shown in ﬁgure 3, since there are two inequivalent\ncorners (K and K′ points) in the hexagonal BZ. One possibility for q is phonon scattering\nwithin the same K (or K′) point denoted by qintra (ﬁgure 3(a)) and the other is phonon\nscattering from the K to K′ point (or from the K′ to K point) denoted by qinter (ﬁgure 3(b)),\nwhich we call intra-valley and inter-valley scattering, respectively. Since equi-energy lines of\nelectronic energy around the K or K′ points are circles, the possible q vectors can lie on circles\nrotated around the \u0002 or K points for intra-valley or inter-valley scattering processes. In ﬁgure 4\nwe show this situation for the cases of (a) intra-valley and (b) inter-valley scattering. It is noted\nthat the difference in diameter for the two circles for k and k + q in ﬁgure 4 is for clarity\ntaken to be much larger than for the real case. Thus, possible regions of q are within a large\ncircle whose diameter is close to 2k measured from the centre of the large circle. However,\nwhen we consider the phonon density of states which satisﬁes the double resonance condition,\nthere are singular points at q ∼0 and q ∼2k in the phonon density of states [25]. Thus we\ncan observe q ∼0 and q ∼2k phonon modes as double resonance modes. For q ∼2k phonon\nmodes, q is selected as 2k which is a function of Elaser. When we see the phonon dispersion\nrelation of graphite (see ﬁgure 5 (b)), there is only the 1350 cm−1 phonon energy around the K\npoint, and we can assign D- and G′-band phonons as the intervalley scattering phonons around\nthe K point. In the case of the G′ band, since the Raman shift becomes approximately twice\nthat of the D band, the slope of the dispersive ∂ωG′/∂Elaser becomes twice that of ∂ωD/∂Elaser.\nThis is the reason for Feature 1.\nAs discussed in the previous section, in the case of the D band, one of the two scattering\nprocesses is not phonon-related scattering, but is rather elastic scattering by a defect. On the\nother hand, since the G′ band corresponds to two-phonon processes, we do not need defects\nfor the G′-band scattering processes, thus providing an explanation for the difference between\nthe D- and G′-band properties (Feature 2).\nFigure 5(a) plots the Elaser dependence of the frequency of the peaks in the density of (k, q)\npairs [16].

Solid and open circles correspond to the phonon modes around\nthe K (qKK′) and \u0002 (qKK) points, respectively. Along the \u0002–K direction, qKK changes from \u0002\nto ∼1\n4K as Elaser increases from 0 to 3.0 eV, while qKK′ changes from K to ∼3\n4K, so that 1\n2\nof the BZ along \u0002–K is probed by this range of Elaser. Figure 5(b) shows the graphite phonon\ndispersion relations in the \u0002–K direction [14, 33]. Vertical dotted lines show the limits for the\nqKK and qKK′ wave vectors imposed by Elaser ≤3.0 eV.\nBy using the Elaser ↔q relations given in ﬁgure 5(a), we can take experimental values\nfrom several published papers giving Raman frequencies observed using different laser lines\nfor various sp2 carbons, and we plot all these data points in ﬁgure 5(b), as is usually done for\ninelastic neutron scattering determinations of the phonon branches. The symbols in ﬁgure 5(b)\nshow experimental values for highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) [26, 28], pyrolytic\ngraphite (PG) [26], single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) [17, 29, 30], 12C ion implanted\nHOPG (C-HOPG) [27], micro-crystalline graphite (MG) [18], and graphite whiskers\n(GW) [31].\nThis approach allows us to assign several Raman features previously observed for these\nmaterials. For example, Tan et al [31] reported two dispersive relatively lower phonon\nfrequency modes in GW, which we assign to two of the three acoustic modes (iTA and LA\nin ﬁgure 5(b)), which are resonant by an intra-valley scattering process.

Furthermore, the broad weak signal around\n1580 cm−1 which is a background of the strong G-band peaks, is assigned to the LO phonon\nbranch (q ∼0) near the \u0002 point [34, 35]. Around 1605 cm−1, we can see weak features,\ndenoted by D∗, which originate from the top of the phonon dispersion relations of graphite.\nThe D∗band can be assigned to the intraband q = 2k double resonance Raman spectra. It\nis noted here that some other groups use a different notation for D∗and G′. The calculated\nfrequencies and their dispersion are in excellent agreement with the experimental results for all\nof these features (see ﬁgure 5(b)). On the other hand, we can ﬁt the phonon dispersion relation\nso as to reproduce the q-Elaser pairs obtained from double resonance spectroscopy, whose\nresults are shown in ﬁgure 5(c) [32]. The ﬁtted phonon dispersion relations are different,\nespecially around the K point, from that obtained using the original force constant set. This\npoint should be clariﬁed in detail in future experimental and theoretical work.\nIn solid state physics, the phonon dispersion relations of a solid are determined by either\n(1) neutron scattering measurements or (2) angle-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy\ndata. Thus double resonance Raman spectroscopy is an alternative method for obtaining the\nphonon dispersion relations for graphite-related materials [16, 24]. The merits of this method\nare: (a) no large single crystal is needed, (b) a disordered sample is preferable, (c) the accuracy\nof the method is similar throughout the BZ even at the zone-boundary.\nFinally, to explain Feature 3, we should consider the length of q for the four different one-\nphonon, second-order processes for Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts, as shown in ﬁgure 6 [25].\nThe processes (b1)–(b4) in ﬁgure 1 correspond to a–d in ﬁgure 6 for intervalley scattering,\nwhich is relevant to the D and G′ bands. For a given laser energy and phonon energies, the\nintermediate states around the K′ point show four different k + q states for each of the Stokes\nand anti-Stokes processes.

Let us denote the other frequencies in the Stokes and anti-\nStokes spectra, respectively, by D1 and D3 (D1 < D2 < D3).\nIn the case of two-phonon second-order Raman scattering, only the a and d processes in\nﬁgure 6 are possible by changing the elastic process to an inelastic process. In this case q for\nprocess d becomes smaller (or larger) for the Stokes (or anti-Stokes) spectra and becomes the\nsame q vector as for the process a. Thus the two processes a and d for the G′ band merge into a\nsingle frequency which is exactly twice that of D1 (or D3) [25].\nIn ﬁgure 7, we plot the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra of the D and G′ bands for\ndisordered graphite, with (a) Elaser = 1.92 eV and (b) Elaser = 2.54 eV. We intentionally ﬁt\nthe D and G′ bands by two and one Lorentzians (Lorentzian is a function for resonance\nphenomena [3, 4]), respectively, and the ﬁtted results show that the above analysis ﬁts the\nexperimental data quite well [25]. Since this ﬁtting procedure works at a different laser\nexcitation energy, we can conclude that only double resonance theory can explain Feature 3.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 157.1–157.15 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",
    "157.10\nDEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n4. D band of nanotube\nIn the case of SWNTs, the 2D electronic and phonon energy dispersion relations of graphite\nare zone-folded along the circumferential direction, which is realized by cutting the 2D BZ\nby lines, to obtain a set of 1D energy dispersion relations for SWNTs [14, 36]. The double\nresonance theory of graphite can be applied to SWNTs based on either the zone-folded BZ\nor on cutting lines in the extended 2D BZ. For simplicity, we explain the double resonance in\nthe unfolded 2D BZ. Since optical absorption is necessary in the resonance Raman process,\nvan Hove singularities in the JDOS are essential for obtaining a strong photo absorption (or\nemission) and for Raman spectra from a single nanotube. Each van Hove singularity in the\nJDOS comes from the ﬂat energy dispersion point on the cutting line, denoted by ki [6, 37].\nWhen the initial (ﬁnal) k and (or) the scattered k + q are van Hove singular ki points, the\ncorresponding D- and G′-band features are enhanced signiﬁcantly [7].\nIn the case of the G′ band of SWNTs, it is not generally possible that both k and k + q are\nsimultaneously ki points, since the E(k) and E(k + q) states have different phonon energies.\nThus, even if the double resonance condition was satisﬁed for the 1D k and k + q vectors,\neither E(k) or E(k + q) would not correspond to an energy where a van Hove singularity\noccurs. An anomalous special situation might occur when the energy difference between two\ndifferent Eii’s of an SWNT coincides with the phonon energy [7]. This situation is possible\nfor special metallic nanotubes, for which the van Hove singular DOS is split into two peaks\nby the trigonal warping effect [37, 38] and the split happens to equal a phonon frequency.\nBy utilizing the momentum conservation in the unfolded 2D BZ for the electron–phonon\ninteraction process, we conclude that such an anomalous resonance situation can only happen\nfor intravalley q = 2k or intervalley q = 0 scattering processes, because the two split VHSs in\nmetallic SWNTs appear on two different sides of the K point.\nIn the case of the D-band of SWNTs, it is possible that both the k and k + q wavevectors\nare ki points, since the initial k and ﬁnal k + q states can have the same energy if the scattering\nprocess is elastic. As discussed in the previous section, there are four possible, one-phonon,\nsecond-order, double resonance processes. In the case of SWNTs, when both the initial and\nﬁnal states of the elastic process are real electronic states (b and c in ﬁgure 6), we expect\na signiﬁcant Raman intensity at the van Hove singularity. Since these two processes give\ndifferent phonon frequencies, the observed D-band spectra of the SWNT should therefore be\nﬁtted by two Lorentzians [5, 6], which appear at different resonant laser excitation energies.\nIn the experiment, we observe the D-band spectra for an isolated single wall carbon\nnanotube when an optical transition occurs between VHSs from the valence to the conduction\nbands [39]. Because of this effect, we can explain an oscillatory behaviour of the D- and\nG′-band phonon frequencies versus Elaser observed in SWNT bundles [17] by the double\nresonance process [7, 37, 39]. When an equi-energy contour touches the cutting lines of\nthe 1D BZ, the touching point corresponds to ki. The resonant nature of a given intermediate\nfrequency mode spectrum has been observed by a tunable laser [40]. The double resonance\nprocess occurs from (or to) ki points in the case of SWNTs, while all k points on the energy\ncontour are possible for 2D graphite. Thus for SWNTs, the contributing phonon q vectors\nare limited, and they are not isotropic around the K point, which is the case of 2D graphite\n(see ﬁgure 4). Thus in the case of SWNTs, the double resonance process not only determines\nthe distance of the q vector from the K point, but also speciﬁes the direction of the q vector.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 157.1–157.15 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

When we move the vector AB to \u0002C,\nit is clear that K′C = 2K′A′ in which A′ is equivalent to the A point in\nthe 2D Brillouin zone [5].

The frequency difference for two\ndifferent q-vector directions KM and K\u0002, \u0006ωph = 24 cm−1 [6].\nSince the direction of the cutting lines depends on the chiral angle [14], the chirality\ndependence of ωD for isolated SWNTs is well explained by the distance of the ki points from\nthe K point [39]. The inter-valley phonon q vectors which connect two ki points A and B\nare shown in ﬁgure 8(a). When A is located at ki, the inequivalent B point is located at −ki,\nand for any position of ki, we can shift A and B to the nearest K′ and K points as shown in\nﬁgure 8(a), using the periodicity of k in the BZ. Further, when we shift the A point to the\n\u0002 point, the ﬁnal point B moves to C which lies at −2ki position from the same K′ point.\nThus, the phonon frequency of the D band is relevant to the ki distance, and more precisely\nto the opposite side of ki from the K point. Since the trigonal warping effect affects both the\nki position and the phonon frequency, a chirality dependence of the D-band frequency was\nobserved [39].\nThe chirality dependence of the double resonance Raman feature frequency arises from\nanisotropy (trigonal warping effect) of both the electronic dispersion relations [39] and the\nphonon dispersion relations [6] around the K point, because of the chirality dependence\nof the q vector direction, as discussed above. By measuring the double resonance Raman\nspectra from SWNTs of different chiralities for a given laser excitation energy, one can\nextract information regarding the phonon trigonal warping effect along the electronic equi-\nenergy contours around the \u0002 and K points in the 2D BZ of the graphene layer. The phonon\nfrequencies obtained from double resonance Raman features must be up-shifted to account\nfor the force constant softening induced by the curvature of the SWNT wall [41]. Such\nmeasurements are very sensitive to the electronic trigonal warping effect, which determines\nthe magnitudes of the k vector for different SWNT chiralities. The electronic trigonal warping\neffect, which is known from experimental studies of graphite and SWNTs as well as from\ntheory [38], needs to be decoupled from experimental data of double resonance Raman\nfrequencies for a proper determination of the phonon trigonal warping effect. Following this\nprocedure, the trigonal warping effect of the iTO phonon mode around the K point has been\nmeasured from the G′-band frequencies of 11 individual SWNTs of different chiralities and\nsimilar diameters probed at the 514.5 and 488 nm Ar ion laser lines [6].

The value of 24 cm−1 for\nthe variation of ωiTO due to trigonal warping is not a negligible value [6], compared with the\nslope of the G′-band frequency.\n5. Other intermediate phonon modes\nFinally, we brieﬂy mention some other peaks which are related to two-phonon modes. There\nare several overtone and combination phonon modes appearing in graphite-based materials.\nUsing the double resonance theory, we assign speciﬁc combination modes to these features\nin the Raman spectra. An important fact for assigning the combination mode is that we\ncannot expect to observe a combination mode of intra-valley (q ∼\u0002) and inter-valley (q ∼K)\nscattering, since the different q vectors cannot be selected in a second-order Raman process.\nFor two-phonon modes, it is not easy to do an assignment of the combination modes for\nconventional graphite, since the signal of two-phonon scattering becomes broader than that for\none-phonon scattering. Thus an SWNT bundle is suitable for ﬁnding a signal if the resonance\nRaman condition is fulﬁlled.\nIn ﬁgure 9 we show the results for the Raman features that appear in an SWNT bundle.\nTwo features appear in the resonance Raman spectra at around 1750 cm−1 and we call these\nfeatures the M band. The M-mode feature is interpreted as an overtone mode of the oTO\nphonon modes. The upper feature mode has a large dispersion around 1850–2050 cm−1 and is\nidentiﬁed with a combination mode of iTO and LA phonon modes, and therefore this mode is\ncalled iTOLA.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 157.1–157.15 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",

See\ntext for the corresponding references.\neThe value of ∂ω/∂E is ﬁnite for a double resonance process (see text).\nfThis value is taken from the work of Tan et al [42].\nMaultzsch and co-workers proposed that the G-band modes in graphite and SWNTs,\nwhich have been understood as ﬁrst-order Raman active modes, are entirely double resonance\nRaman processes [24, 35]. The phonon energy dispersion for the highest phonon mode (LO)\nincreases in energy with increasing k value from the point \u0002 (see ﬁgure 5) [14, 32] which can\nbe seen by double resonance Raman spectroscopy as discussed in section 3 [16]. Group theory\ntells us, on the other hand, that the G band is the Raman-active mode of graphite [14]. The\nG-band feature is always strong, which does not depend on the number of defects. Thus the\nﬁrst-order Raman process should work except when there are any special reasons that suppress\nthe ﬁrst-order process. Thus further work is needed to understand the relationship between\nﬁrst-order and double resonance processes for the G band.\nIn table 1 we list all Raman spectra observed in graphite and SWNTs, where not only\nﬁrst-order Raman, but also the second-order Raman spectral features are included. Mainly, the\nslopes of the dispersive phonon modes for graphitic materials are also given.\n6. Summary\nIn summary, using double resonance Raman theory, we can assign many known weak Raman\nfeatures of carbon materials appearing below 3000 cm−1. The dispersive nature of these\nRaman features and the discrepancy between phonon frequencies of the Stokes and anti-\nStokes spectra can be explained. Further, the phonon dispersion relations can be obtained\nby analysing many peaks from many experiments. In the case of SWNTs, by including the\nsingularities in the JDOS, we can get sharp double resonance Raman peaks, which are suitable\neven for obtaining the anisotropy of the phonon dispersion relations.\nNew Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 157.1–157.15 (http://www.njp.org/)\n",
