Our single-walled carbon nanotubes were produced by the improved floating reactant method, which combines the conventional\nsubstrate and floating catalyst methods using zeolite particles as a floating catalyst support. This finding is also important because small-\ndiameter nanotubes were proved to be able to grow without any confinement that limits the tube diameter such as in the tube growth in a\ntemplate or in the central core of a multiwalled nanotube, as reported in previous studies by other groups. The success of obtaining very\nsmall single-walled carbon nanotubes opens the door to unprecedented applications of this fascinating material as a true 1D material.\nThe quest for small-diameter carbon nanotubes is important\nfor making use of the size effect that is predicted to lead to\ndifferent properties from those for larger nanotubes.1 The\nSWCNTs reported in the present study were produced by a\nnanozeolite floating-reactant method. The floating-reactant\nmethod, primarily used to produce vapor-grown carbon\nfibers, nanofibers, and nanotubes2,3 on the basis of the use\nof small catalytic particles, is one of the most promising\nmethods for the mass production of carbon nanotubes, and\nit has already been industrialized by several companies\nworldwide. The zeolite template method4 is known for its\nability to produce thin nanotubes and SWCNTs as well, but\nit is hard to produce carbon nanotubes in mass. Another\nmethod using porous materials such as zeolites is the method\nof catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons over supported\ncatalyst5-7, which allows for easier control of tube quality\nand production.8 However, to produce small-diameter nano-\ntubes in a commercial base, a continuous process is favorable.\nBy combining improved versions of both the floating reactant\nmethod and the catalyst support method, we obtain a very\nattractive method for the mass production of thin SWCNTs.\nWe note here that the zeolite used in the present method is\nnot used as a template for the formation of the SWCNT but\nrather is used to limit the size and structure of the catalytic\nparticles, which have much to do with controlling the\ndiameter and the growth process of the resulting carbon\nnanotubes. In the present report, we have used a fine zeolite\npowder as a catalyst support and as a floating substrate and\niron as a catalyst to grow small-diameter carbon nanotubes.\nPapers have been published on the synthesis and observa-\ntion of small-diameter nanotubes9-11 Some concerned the\ninnermost cylinder of a multiwalled tube,9,11 and another10\nleft a margin for argument12,13 because of specimen prepara-\ntion or the production method of the tube. Our observation\ndiffers from those reported previously in that our observed\nsmall-diameter single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is\nnot on an amorphous film that disturbs the observation nor\nis it located in the central core part of a multiwalled carbon\nnanotube that is virtually useless. Another important point\nis that the small-diameter SWCNTs in the present study were\nproduced in an unconfined system unlike those in previously\nreported papers, which used a template10 or the central part\nof a multiwalled nanotube.9,11 These distinctions are very\nimportant for the advancement of the SWCNT synthesis field\nand of the related fields of properties measurements and\napplications to obtain direct visual proof of the existence of\nthe isolated small-diameter SWCNT as reported here.\nThe material thus obtained was treated with hydrofluoric\nacid to remove the zeolite and then was washed with nitric\nacid and observed in the transmission electron microscope\n(TEM). The TEM used in the present study was a JEOL\n* Corresponding author.

    "JEM-2010FEF instrument equipped with an in-column\nΩ-type energy filter, which greatly contributed to the ease\nof observation. The operating voltage of the TEM was 200\nkV\nLow-magnification observations showed that the sample\nconsisted mainly of two parts: bundles of SWCNTs and\nlarge hollow spherical carbon particles. We could also find\nsome metal particles that remained unwashed. Higher-\nmagnification observations showed that the tubes in the\nbundles were all single-walled nanotubes with a diameter\naround 1 nm, and the particles were made of rather\nturbostratic carbon layers. The small-diameter SWCNT, as\nshown in Figure 1, was found to be isolated from other\nbundles and could be clearly observed through the use of\nthe energy filter equipped in the TEM. The diameter of the\ntube was measured to be 0.426 nm,14 which is the smallest-\ndiameter nanotube yet to be produced by the CVD method,\nand to our knowledge, it is the smallest-diameter tube ever\nto be observed as a free-standing or isolated structure. The\ntube was unstable under electron beam irradiation during\nTEM observations in comparison with other thicker SWCNTs\nand deformed within a minute, even when we were trying\nto bring the camera into focus, showing behavior very similar\nto that of a polymer sample. From the observed diameter,\ntaking the pixel error due to the digital data acquisition with\nthe CCD camera into account and by comparing with the\nobserved and simulated TEM images of the SWCNT model\nas shown in the inset of Figure 1, we propose that the\nnanotube can be assigned the (5, 1) or (4, 2) indices, which\ngive a diameter of 0.436 or 0.414 nm, respectively. We have\nto stress that it is hard to be sure about the assignment\nbecause of the deformation due to the irradiation effect.\nWe could not find the end of the tube because of the\nsufficiently long length of the tube and because it is mostly\noverlapped with either bundles of SWCNTs or with carbon\nparticles. But it is worthwhile to note that the diameter of\nthe small tube is consistent with the diameter of a C20\nFigure 1. High-resolution transmission electron microscope image\nof a small SWNT.

    "molecule,15 and we can imagine that if there exists an end\nof a (5, 1) tube then it should be like the model shown in\nFigure 2, which is capped with six adjacent pentagonal rings\nand can be closed with no difficulty.\nThere are two major mechanisms for the catalytic growth\nof carbon nanotubes depending on the position of the catalyst,\nwhere the tube growth occurs. As shown in Figure 3, one is\nthe tip-growth mechanism whereby the catalyst particle is\nat the tip of the tube, and the other is the root-growth\nmechanism whereby the catalytic particle is placed at the\nroot of the tube. For the SWCNTs in the present study, as\nshown in Figure 4, catalytic particles can be found both at\nthe root and at the tip of the tubes. This indicates that two\nmajor growth mechanisms coexist in the growth of our small-\ndiameter SWCNT. Moreover, we can imagine that both\ngrowth mechanisms are qualitatively the same depending on\nthe position of the catalyst particle that plays a role as a\ncarbon feeding source.\nWe have shown the successful observation of the smallest\nfree-standing SWCNT and present a production method that\nis promising for the mass production of small SWCNTs.\nSuch small-diameter SWCNTs, which are virtually equivalent\nto 1D material, have a wide variety of potential applications\nsuch as gas storage devices, energy storage devices, and\nsensor applications.\nAcknowledgment.\nThis work was supported by the\nCLUSTER of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,\nScience and Technology.\nReferences\n(1) Peng, L.-M. et al.
