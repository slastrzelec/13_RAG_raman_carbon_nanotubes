Asthanac∗\nMulti-walledcarbonnanotube(MWCNT)ﬁltershavebeenrecentlysynthesisedwhichhavespeciﬁcmolecularﬁlteringcapabilities\nand good mechanical strength. Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals the formation of highly aligned arrays\nof bundles of carbon nanotubes having lengths up to 500 µm. The Raman spectra of this material along with four other\ncarbonaceous materials, commercially available single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and MWCNTs, graphitised porous\ncarbon (Carbotrap) and graphite have been recorded using two-excitation wavelengths, 532 and 785 nm, and analysed for\nband positions and shape with special emphasis paid to the D-, G- and G′-bands. A major difference between the different\nMWCNT varieties analysed is that G-bands in the MWCNT ﬁlters exhibit almost no dispersion, whereas the other MWCNTs show\na noticeable dispersive behaviour with a change in the excitation wavelength. Spectral features similar to those of the MWCNT\nﬁlter varieties were observed for the Carbotrap material. From the line shape analysis, the intensity ratio, ID/IG, of the more\nordered MWCNT ﬁlter material using the integral G-band turns out to be two times lower than that of the less ordered MWCNT\nﬁlter product at both excitation wavelengths. This parameter can, therefore, be used as a measure of the degree of MWCNT\nalignment in ﬁlter varieties, which is well supported also by our SEM study.

The lattice dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of sp2\ncarbonmaterialshavebeenthesubjectofnumerousinvestigations\nand some representatives (Refs [1–6)] are cited here. Raman\nspectroscopy has been an important tool in investigating such\nmaterials because their spectrum is particularly sensitive to the\nmicrostructure of the carbon. Raman scattering from carbons is\nalways a resonant process, in which those conﬁgurations whose\nband gaps match the excitation energy are preferentially excited.\nAny mixture of sp3, sp2 and sp carbon atoms may have a band gap\nbetween 0 and 6 eV. Fortunately, this energy range matches with\nelectromagnetic radiation in the infrared, visible and ultraviolett\n(IR-VIS-UV) regions and hence these materials are well suited for\na Raman study using almost any excitation wavelength, thereby\nmaking a dispersion study quite conveniently feasible.\nBesides graphite and diamond, the discovery of fullerenes and\nsubsequently of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) added a new dimension\nin carbon science. CNTs are long, cylindrical molecules consisting\nof a circular array of nearly sp2 hybridised carbon atoms. The\nwell-known CNTs prepared in the past have been classiﬁed as\nsingle-wallednanotubes(SWNTs)[6–8] andmulti-wallednanotubes\n(MWNTs)[9] witheachtubeembeddedwithinalargertube.Usually,\nSWNTs show diameters of approximately 1 nm and a length of\n1–100 µm. In an interesting article, the relationship of CNTs to\nother carbon materials has been discussed by Dresselhaus and\nEndo.[10] Many different methods exist to grow CNTs and the\nmost widely used techniques are arc discharge, laser furnace, and\nchemical vapour deposition (CVD), which have been reviewed\nrecently.[11,12] Large aligned-nanotube bundles from ferrocene\npyrolysis have been reported by Rao et al.[13] A special variety\n∗Correspondence to: B.

    "345\nCharacterisation of carbonaceous materials using Raman spectroscopy\nof CNTs of relatively larger length forming macroscopic hollow\ncylinders with radially aligned CNT walls has been reported by\nSrivastava et al.,[14] which have been successfully used as ﬁlters\nfor compound separation. Intricate applications like ﬁltering a\nbacterialpollutantandcompoundswithhighoctanenumberfrom\ngasoline suggest that these nanotubes are suitable for industrial\napplications.\nIn recent years, Raman spectroscopy has been used as a\npowerful tool to characterise different types of carbonaceous\nmaterials, especially in the case of CNT varieties. Besides Raman\nspectra, UV-VIS-NIR spectra also of individual single-walled carbon\nnanotubes (SWCNTs) were recorded by Thomsen and Reich[15]\nand interpreted for electronic excitations existing in various types\nof tubes. Reviews on Raman spectroscopy of isolated SWCNTs\nhave recently been published by Dresselhaus et al.[6,16] The basic\nconcepts and characteristics of Raman spectra from CNTs, both\nisolated and bundled, that were based on studies by resonance\nRaman scattering, have been presented by Jorio et al.[17] A Raman\nspectroscopic method has been recently devised for analysis\nof mixtures of SWCNTs and multi-walled carbon nanotubes\n(MWCNTs), which also gives a detailed description of the spectral\ndifferences observed for both carbon varieties.[18] Because of\nthe large diameters of MWCNTs, containing also an ensemble of\nnanotubes with varying diameters, most of the characteristic\ndifferences observed for SWCNT spectra, when compared to\nthose of graphite and similar materials, are not so evident for\nMWCNTs. The Raman spectroscopy of MWCNTs has not been well\ninvestigated up to now, which is a recent observation by the\nDresselhaus group.[6] In view of this fact, the Raman spectra of our\nradially aligned MWCNT ﬁlter varieties may give further insight\ninto the spectra-structure correlation.\nBesides the use of MWCNT as ﬁlters, such materials have also\nbeen brought into play as a sorbent phase for separation tech-\nniques (as described in the recent review by Valc´arcel et al.[19]).\nWhen contemplating on their adsorption characteristics, we also\nincluded a variety of porous graphitised carbon black in our study.\nGraphitised carbon-based adsorbents are commercially available\nunder the trade names Carbopack and Carbotrap, whereas carbon\nmolecular sieves are available, e.g. under Carbosieve (all from\nSupelco, Bellefonte, PA). The carbon molecular sieves consist of\na carbon skeletal framework that remains after pyrolysis of a\npolymeric precursor. The carbon molecular sieves are designed\nto trap smaller, more volatile compounds while the graphitised\ncarbon blacks are better suited for larger, less volatile compounds.\nOther ordered and disordered mesoporous carbons, with similar\nmicroporosity and surface properties as those of graphitised car-\nbon black Carbopack, were recently prepared and investigated by\nRaman spectroscopy, giving evidence for the increased sp2 car-\nbon structures.[20] Other carbonaceous materials such as carbon\nblacks and soot have recently been found interesting by using Ra-\nman spectroscopy at different laser excitation wavelengths, which\nincluded a band analysis.[5] With regard to the reactivity of car-\nbonaceous materials, a Raman spectroscopic study of ordered and\ndisordered carbon varieties such as coke and charcoal was studied\nrecently.[4] Tan et al.[21] presented a review on the Raman study\nof several different and less-common non planar graphite mate-\nrials, where the polarisation properties related to the structural\nfeatures, line shape of ﬁrst-order dispersive mode and its combina-\ntion modes, variation of wavenumber and other unique features\nwere discussed and some of the new features were explained\nusing the double resonance mechanism. Thomsen et al.,[22] in an-\nother review, identiﬁed six criteria which help in understanding\nthe role of the double resonance process, and they applied these\ncriteria to the experimental results for the radial breathing mode\n(RBM) and the D mode. Kneipp et al.[23] exploited the effect of sur-\nface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) when the SWCNTs were\nin contact with silver or gold nanostructures, where the Raman\nsignal could be enhanced by up to 14 orders of magnitude, which\nallowed a measurement from even a single SWCNT.\nIn view of the earlier studies and foregoing discussions, it was\nthought worthwhile to take up the task of a rather complete\ncharacterisation of CNT ﬁlters from a Raman spectroscopic\npoint of view in relation to the spectra of other related\ncarbonaceous materials. In this study, besides Raman spectra\nrecorded with different laser excitation wavelengths, we also\npresent optical, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-\nresolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM) micrographs, which\ngive a clear idea regarding the degree of nanotube alignment\nand their graphitisation. In contrast to this, the porous structure\nin the graphitised carbon black is also evident from its SEM\nstudy. Despite the fact that many papers have been published\non the structural analysis by vibrational spectroscopy, a universal\nevaluation method has not yet been developed for carbonaceous\nmaterials with widely differing structures. However, with this\ncontribution some additional insights are obtained.\nExperimental\nMaterials\nMacro-scale hollow carbon cylinders up to a few centimetres\nin diameter and several centimetres long consisting of MWCNT\nﬁlters with diameters ranging from 20 to 50 nm thickness were\nsynthesised using a continuous spray pyrolysis method with a\nspray of ferrocene-derived iron particles acting as the catalyst. The\nnanotubes grow in radial directions on the walls of removable\nsilica tube templates leading to the formation of freestanding and\ncontinuous hollow cylindrical tubes made up of MWCNTs.[14] In\nthis reaction, ferrocene breaks and gives nano-clusters of free iron\nparticles, which function as a catalyst for the growth of CNTs.\nOne of the important features of CNTs synthesised by using a\nferrocene-benzene precursor is that they are produced in high\nyield (1.25 g/run). It was found that the optimum concentration of\nferrocene in benzene for the long-length nanotubes is 5 mg/ml.\nThe two abbreviations of MWCNTI and MWCNTII used hereinafter\nin our entire presentation and discussion stand for the ﬁlter variety\ngrown through spray pyrolysis technique. The optical image from\na powdered MWCNT sample and the SEM as well as the HRTEM\nmicrographs of the MWCNT ﬁlter varieties are shown in Figs 1\nand 2, where the second batch shows a reduced alignment of\nthe individual tubes, which is obvious from the SEM micrographs.\nThe inner and outer diameters of the MWCNT ﬁlter varieties are\n∼15 and ∼30 nm, respectively, as determined by the transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) study.\nFor a comparative study, some other CNTs were purchased from\nAldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). The SWNTs were procured from\nCarboLex, Inc. of Lexington (Kentucky, USA). The batch quantity\n(product # 519308) obtained was of AP-grade (as-prepared, i.e.\nnon-chemically puriﬁed), which consisted of bundles of SWCNTs\nwith 10–200 individual nanotubes per bundle with an average\ndiameter of 1.2–1.5 nm and a bundle length of ∼20 µm. The\npurity of the AP-grade was stated to range between 50 and\n70% by volume, as determined by Raman spectroscopy and SEM.\nMajor impurities as mentioned by the manufacturer were carbon\nJ.

    "347\nCharacterisation of carbonaceous materials using Raman spectroscopy\nnanospheresandcarbon-encapsulatedcatalystnanoparticles. The\nsecond SWCNT material (product # 636797) was characterised\nhaving a mean diameter of 1–2 nm, as determined by HRTEM.\nPurity was analysed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and a\nSWCNT content >50% with an average outside diameter of 1.1 nm\nand a length of 0.5–100 µm (the extent of impurities as quoted\ncould be amorphous carbon: ∼3%, other nanotubes: ∼40%) was\nreported by the manufacturer.\nWe also procured MWCNTs from Aldrich for which Raman\nspectra were recorded. These MWCNTs had the following\ncharacteristics: batch 1 (O.D. × I.D. × length = 30–50 nm ×\n5–15 nm × 0.5–200 µm; carbon content >95%) and batch 2\n(O.D. × I.D. × length = 10–20 nm × 5–10 nm × 0.5–200 µm;\ncarbon content >95%) with a purity determined by thermo-\ngravimetric analysis. Since the spectra of the two batches did not\nshowanysigniﬁcantdifferences,thedataforonlythesecondbatch\nare presented and further discussed.

Other materials selected for\na comparative study were pure graphite and Carbotrap 20/40\nmesh from Supelco, Bellefonte (PA, USA). The SEM micrograph of\nCarbotrap along with those of the ﬁlter varieties (MWCNTI and\nMWCNTII) are shown in Fig. 2. The material, a graphitised carbon\nblack, is commonly used as adsorbent for trapping trace volatile\norganic pollutants ranging from C4/C5 compounds to substances\nof medium volatility. We have concentrated our Raman studies on\nthe band analysis of ﬁve materials: MWCNT ﬁlter, another MWCNT\nvariety(batch2),onesetofSWCNT(procuredfromAldrich,product\n# 636797), graphite and Carbotrap.\nOptical and scanning electron microscopy\nFor optical microscopy, we used an infrared microscope (IR-\nmicroscope) (model Auto IMAGE) for transmission measurements\nattached to a Perkin-Elmer – 2000 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)\nspectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, ¨Uberlingen, Germany). The scanning\nelectron microscopic study was made using a SEM (model-\nXL20) from Philips Instruments (Eindhoven, The Netherlands).\nThe HRTEM study was carried out using a model JEM-3010 from\nJEOL Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).\nRaman measurements\nFor Raman measurements, two different spectrometers with\ntwo different excitation wavelengths were used. The XY-Dilor\nRaman spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon GmbH) is a dispersive\nresearch Raman spectrometer. It consists of a triple 0.5 m\nmonochromator and uses the frequency-doubled radiation from\na Nd-YAG laser (excitation wavelength of 532 nm with 500\nmW) and a liquid nitrogen cooled charge-coupled device (CCD)\n(from Wright Instruments Ltd) for detection. The measurements\nin the present study were carried out using a slit width of\n100 µm with an integration time of 1000 s and 25 spectral frame\naccumulations. A confocal Raman microscope is coupled to the\nRaman spectrometer, providing spectra from sample spots down\nto about 1 µm2, which can be used for the analysis of composition\nand structure of small particles, inclusions or material defects.\nFurther measurements were carried out using a diode laser\nbased Raman system, which was a portable HoloSpec Raman\nspectrometer from Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc., equipped with a\ndiode laser (λ = 785 nm, 50 mW) from SDL, Inc. and a liquid-N2\n2750\n2500\n2250\n2000\n1750\n1500\n1250\n2750\n2500\n2250\n2000\n1750\n1500\n1250\nλ = 532 nm\nMWCNT (batch 2)\nMWCNTI\nMWCNTII\nSWCNT (Aldrich)\nSWCNT (CarboLex)\nCarbotrap\nGraphite\nRaman intensity\n(a)\n(b)\nλ = 785 nm\nMWCNTII\nMWCNTI\nMWCNT (batch 2)\nSWCNT (CarboLex)\nSWCNT (Aldrich)\nRaman intensity\nWavenumber / cm-1\nCarbotrap\nGraphite\nFigure 3.

An integration\ntime of 25 s with 10 spectral frame accumulations was employed\nfor recording the spectra in the present study at a laser power\nof 10 mW. The samples were placed in a cup used for Raman\nspectroscopy of powdered samples.\nResults and Discussion\nOptical, SEM and HRTEM studies\nThe optical images from a powdered MWCNT (ﬁlter) sample as\nshown in Fig. 1(a) are able to suggest the long length and superior\nalignment of carbon nanostructures.

The positions of the\nD-peaks in the spectra of these substances recorded using 785-\nnm excitation wavelength are found at 1308, 1312, 1316, 1310\nand 1314 cm−1, respectively. The D-band of MWCNT shows a\nshift of 39 cm−1 with a change in excitation wavelength from\n532 to 785 nm. In the case of MWCNTI, the shift towards lower\nwavenumberisby∼40 cm−1 withthesameexcitationwavelength\nchange. The D-bands of MWCNTIIs and Carbotrap are shifted by\n∼38 and ∼34 cm−1, respectively towards lower wavenumber\nwhen the excitation wavelength is altered from 532 to 785 nm.\nFrom the experimental observations, it is quite evident that\nthe position and intensity of the D-band is different for various\ncarbonaceous materials. It is a well-known fact that the position of\nD-band in the Raman spectrum appears at different wavenumbers\nwith change in excitation wavelength. The band at ∼1352 cm−1\nis referred to as the main disorder-induced band (D1-band). This\nband occurs when disorder is present in the carbon aromatic\nstructure. It is also sensitive to graphite intercalations. The change\nin the peak position of the D-band with excitation wavelength can\nbe explained in terms of resonance of electronic and vibrational\ndensity of states. In carbonaceous materials, it has been observed\nthat when phonon wavenumbers vary with a change in excitation\nenergy,[15,24–26] a weak Raman signal is obtained.\nThe change of phonon wavenumbers with excitation wave-\nlength is known as dispersive behaviour. In the present study,\na shift of around ∼40 cm−1 was observed for SWCNTs and the\nMWCNTs, when the excitation wavelength was changed as men-\ntionedabove(shiftfortheporousCarbotrapmaterialwas34 cm−1,\nwhile the graphite bar sample analysed showed a difference of\n40 cm−1). Evidently, the spectra obtained for 785-nm excitation\nshowed signiﬁcant D-band intensities for the SWCNT (CarboLex)\nand graphite samples when compared with the Raman spectra\nobtained with 532 nm. This is an important point to be noticed,\nwhen spectra in the literature are presented without stating the\nlaser excitation wavelength. Thus the present study is a good ex-\nample of the dispersive nature of different carbonaceous materials\nat different excitation wavelengths. In the carbonaceous materials,\nthe D-band appears because of one-phonon second order Raman\nscattering process, for which elastic and inelastic scattering events\nare generally involved.[6,26,27]\nIn the Raman spectra of carbonaceous materials, the disorder\nmode is believed to result from disorder and symmetry lowering.\nIn a study of SWCNT by Jorio et al.,[28] it has been reported that\nthe D-band shows a strong dependence on the polarisation of\nthe excitation wavelength. The polarisation dependence studies\ncarried out earlier suggested that the observation of the D-band\nin the Raman spectrum of MWCNTs, where the D-band had been\nassumed to be associated with both the presence of disorder and\nﬁnite size effect of carbons, did not always mean that it could\noriginate only because of the disorder present in the material.\nRecently, an optical study on CNTs and nanographites has been\nmade by Pimenta et al.[29] In this study, it has been pointed out\nthat the D-band also provides information about the size and\norientation of the edges in nanographites. It has also been shown\nin this study that ID/IG for a given sample is strongly dependent on\nthe laser energy and follows a dependence on E−4laser. The values\nof the ratio ID/IG calculated using the integrated intensities of the\nline proﬁles of the D- and G-bands, as shown in Fig. 3, for MWCNTI\nand MWCNTII are 0.31 and 0.55 for the excitation wavelength of\n532 nm,and0.79and1.51fortheexcitationwavelengthof785 nm,\nrespectively. The E−4laser dependence, taking the λ values of 532\nand 785 nm, yields this ratio to be 0.211 as valid for nanographites.\nOur measurements for the special multi-walled varieties were\nmade only for these two wavelengths, and differences may be\nobvious (the corresponding values were found to be 0.39 and 0.36\nfor MWCNTI and MWCNTII, respectively).\nThe D-band as characteristic for disordered graphite shows\nquite signiﬁcant dependency of its intensity on the excitation\nwavelength. It is to be noted that this graphitic lattice vibration\nmode has been assigned to A1g symmetry (refer also to spectra\nand the literature cited in Ref. [5]). In a recent review, Dresselhaus\net al.[30] summarisedthevariousaspectsofRamanstudy,especially\nthe variation of ID/IG ratio with the length of the SWCNTs and con-\ncluded that Resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) would become\none of the major characterisation techniques for the speciﬁcation\nof the CNT samples. It is evident from our study that a careful line\nshapeanalysisanddeterminationofID/IG forMWCNTScanprovide\ninformation on the degree of CNT alignment. A comparison of the\nSEM micrographs of MWCNTI and MWCNTII clearly shows that the\ndegree of alignment in case of MWCNTI is higher than that in case\nofMWCNTII(Fig. 2(a)).ThevaluesofID/IG takingintegratedG-band\nintensities have been calculated for each carbonaceous material\nat both the excitation wavelengths and are given in Table 2. In\naddition, the ID/IG ratio for each component of G-band was also\ncalculated with the results reported in Table 2. It is obvious by a\ncloser examination of these results that in the case of MWCNTI\nthe value of the ratio ID/IG has a smaller value compared to the\ncorresponding value for MWCNTII for the integrated G-band. Thus\na relatively small value of the ratio ID/IG could be a very suitable\nparameter to monitor the degree of alignment in MWCNT bundles.\nRaman G-band\nThe Raman spectra of different carbonaceous materials exper-\nimentally recorded in the region of 1750–1450 cm−1 show\na composite nature of bands, which are assigned as G-band\n(G stands for ‘graphite’) originating from a ﬁrst-order Raman ef-\nfect.

The ﬁtting procedure takes the sum of Lorentzian and\nGaussian fraction (in %), and the ﬁtting routine Spectra Calc has a\nprovision to adjust this ratio to calculate the best ﬁt to the experi-\nmental line proﬁle. Although the ﬁtting is done by taking the sum\nof Lorentzian and Gaussian line shapes, a judicious mixture of the\ntwo proﬁles is nearly as good as a Voigt proﬁle.[31]\nSince we face much larger diameters for the outer tubes for\ntypical MWCNT samples with most samples consisting of an\nensembleofnanotubeswithdifferentdiameters,thecharacteristic\nspectral differences that distinguish Raman spectra of SWCNTs\nfrom those of graphite are not so evident for MWCNTs. As there\naredifferentMWCNTvarietiesthathavenotbeenwellinvestigated\nup to now, some new features were expected to be observed in\nthe Raman spectra of the especially prepared MWCNT ﬁlter variety.\nRecently, Athalin and Lefrant[18] stated that only a single peak with\nafullwidthathalfmaximum(FWHM)larger70 cm−1 wouldappear\nfor MWCNT in contrast to the case of SWCNTs, which could be\ndismissed by our study.\nThe band system in the carbonaceous compounds studied,\nexcept for graphite, is composed of three peaks. Generally, the\nG-band in graphite with an undisturbed graphitic lattice (refer also\nour results in Table 2), nanocrystalline graphite or glassy carbon\ndoes not show dispersion.[3] The G-band shows a dispersive\nbehaviour only for more disordered carbon, with dispersion\nproportional to the degree of disorder. Besides the ﬁrst-order\nD-band, the spectra of our graphite bar sample also show another\nﬁrst-order band at ∼1620 cm−1, which is called D2-band and\naccounts for the structural disorders. Like the G-band of graphite,\nthe D2-band also corresponds to a graphitic lattice mode with\nE2g symmetry.[5] As found for the D1-band, the D2-band intensity\nalso increases with larger excitation wavelength, which has been\nattributed to resonance effects.\nA line shape analysis of the spectra of SWCNTs (Aldrich) yields\nthree peaks at 1574, 1590 and 1607 cm−1 with 532-nm excitation,\nand at 1555, 1582 and 1590 cm−1 with 785-nm excitation. The\nresults of the detailed line shape analysis for each carbonaceous\nmaterial for both the excitation wavelengths are presented in\nTable 2. In a study by Reich et al.,[32] the intensities of Raman-active\nmodes in single and multi-wall nanotubes have been investigated,\nelucidating that the Raman peaks are not due to modes of distinct,\ndifferent symmetry, but a superposition of mainly A1 and weaker\nE contributions.\nThe G-band in CNTs involves an optical phonon mode between\nthe two dissimilar carbon atoms in a unit cell. It is known\nto originate from sp2 carbon sites present in the sample.[1–3]\nThis band essentially represents the ν(C\nC) stretching vibration\nof all pairs of sp2 atoms in the ring. According to group\ntheoretical analysis, the G-band consists of six modes which are\ndistributed as: 2A (A1g), one doubly degenerate E1 (E1g) and\nanother doubly degenerate E2 (E2g) mode. For each symmetrical\nmode, the vibration of atoms is either along the tube axis or\nalong the circumferential direction. The peaks at ∼1574 and\n∼1590 cm−1 for SWCNTs with excitation wavelength 532 nm\nbelong to [A(A1g) + E1(E1g)] irreducible representation (IR) and the\nband at ∼1607 cm−1 belongs to [E2(E2g)] IR. The peaks at ∼1574\nand ∼1590 cm−1 are equally shifted from the central graphite\nband at ∼1582 cm−1 (actually measured here at 1587 cm−1).\nThese symmetry assignments have been supported by polarised\nRaman studies of semi-conducting SWCNTs in the earlier work of\nJorio et al.[28]\nThe shifts have been explained using a model previously\npresented by Kasuya et al.[33] who considered that these modes\nappear at the \u0004 point of the nanotube Brillouin zone as a\nresult of zone folding. Thus two bands at 1574 and 1590 cm−1\nhave equal separation of 8 cm−1 from the central graphite\npeak, ωg = 1582 cm−1. The third peak at ∼1607 cm−1 is at\ndouble separation (∼17 cm−1) from the 1590 cm−1 peak and at\ntriple separation (24 cm−1) from the central graphite peak. The\nmagnitude of the shift between the components of the G-band at\ntwo-excitation wavelengths may be due to the effect of impurities\nin the materials. However, these shifts in the peak positions\nwww.interscience.wiley.com/journal/jrs\nCopyright c⃝2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nJ. Raman Spectrosc. 2009, 40, 344–353\n",
    "351\nCharacterisation of carbonaceous materials using Raman spectroscopy\nfrom the central graphite peak may also be the consequence of\nthe nanotube curvature. The curvature of the nanotube results\nin different force constants along the nanotube axis and the\ncircumferential direction. The nanotube geometry causes a force\nconstant reduction along the tube axis compared to that in the\ncircumferential direction. The curvature effect may, therefore, be\nresponsible for the separation of \u0005ν = 24 cm−1 between the\nA(A1g) + E1(E1g) and E2(E2g) modes. These peaks are reported at\n1567, 1590 and 1607 cm−1 in the study on SWCNT carried out\nby Jorio et al.[28] If we look at Fig. 4(a), the G-band of SWCNTs is\nmainly consisting of two peaks at 1574 and 1590 cm−1, which\nare assigned as G−and G+ bands, respectively. The G+ feature\nis associated with carbon atom vibrations along the nanotube\naxis, known as longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode in semi-\nconductingtubes,anditsfrequencyissensitivetoachargetransfer\nmechanism. However, in case of metallic SWCNTs, the G+ mode is\nassociated with the transverse optical (TO) phonon. The G−mode\nwhich originates from LO modes has Breit–Winger–Fano (BWF)\nline shape and it has been reported that the intensity of the G−\nmode strongly depends on the chiral angle θ for metallic tubes.\nThe peak positions of the G+ and G−bands in SWCNTs\nwith 785-nm excitation wavelength are 1582 and 1590 cm−1,\nrespectively. The G peak of the investigated SWCNTs with 785-\nnm excitation also splits into three band components at 1555,\n1582 and 1590 cm−1 (Table 2). Thus the shift of the band at\n1555 cm−1 from the central graphite peak amounts to 27 cm−1.\nCompared to the spectrum recorded with 532-nm excitation,\nthe band shifts and intensity differences make it impossible\nto have a symmetry assignment without further veriﬁcation\nby polarised Raman scattering studies, although the peak at\n∼1582 cm−1 matches nicely with the central graphite G-band\nbelonging to E2(E2g) species. The assignment problem in the\nspectra of SWCNT and MWCNT has been discussed by Reich\net al.[32] Besides the mixed symmetry of the bands, the band\ncomponent corresponding to A species will be most intense.[28]\nIn this context, it is noteworthy that a review on the symmetry-\nrelated properties of CNTs has been recently published by Barros\net al.,[34] where excitonic effects have been taken into account,\nbut Kohn anomaly effects have not been included. In a very\nrecent study, Piscanec et al.[35] presented a review on the optical\nphonon dispersions of graphene and CNTs, where two Kohn\nanomalies induced by the electron–phonon coupling of E2g\nmode at \u0004 point and A1′ mode at K point were discussed\nusing an approach accounting for the time-independent nature of\nphonons, which was usually neglected in the Born–Oppenheimer\nframework.\nAn important aspect of the G-band is the Raman line shape\nwhich differs in accordance with the metallic or semi-conducting\nnature of the nanotube. In general, in other sp2 carbons, the\nG-band is not dispersive, i.e. its wavenumber is not sensitive\nto the excitation wavelength.[2] In the present study, however,\nwe observed a shift in wavenumber position of both G+ and\nG−bands with a change of excitation wavelength, which might\nbe also caused by some impurities present in the sample. The\nG−and G+ modes with 532 nm excitation appear at 1574\nand 1590 cm−1, respectively and at 1555 and at 1590 cm−1,\nrespectively, with 785-nm excitation. It clearly shows that the\nG−mode is downshifted by ∼19 cm−1 with a change of excitation\nwavelength from 532 nm to the longer wavelength of 785 nm.\nOn the other hand, the G+ mode does not show any signiﬁcant\nshift on varying the excitation wavelength. In the Raman spectra\nof isolated semi-conducting CNTs, the G−and G+ modes show\nLorentzian character.[31] However, both modes show different\nfeatures for metallic CNTs. In the case of SWCNTs, the G+\nmode shows Lorentzian lineshape with relatively small linewidth\n(FWHM = 21 cm−1) while the G−peak shows a line shape with\na relatively large width (FWHM = 48 cm−1). In the present study,\nboth G+ and G−bands could be ﬁtted nicely using Lorentzian line\nshape functions. The linewidths of G−and G+ modes obtained\nwere 48 and 22 cm−1, respectively (Table 2), where the band of\nthe lower Raman shift mode showed further broadening with\nan increase in excitation wavelength. Nonetheless, the SWCNTs\nused in the present study are predominantly semi-conducting in\ncharacter.\nMulti-walled CNTs can be considered as an ensemble of\nnanotubes with diameters ranging from small to rather large.\nBecause of the large diameters of the outer shells for MWCNT,\nmost differences that can be utilised to distinguish between\nthe Raman spectra of SWCNT and graphite are missing in\nMWCNTs. In our study, a Lorentzian line shape analysis of the\nRaman spectra for all MWCNTs and the microporous Carbotrap\nmaterial in the region 1750–1450 cm−1 for both excitation\nwavelengths, 532 and 785 nm, was carried out, and each\nspectrum was ﬁtted, as mentioned earlier, taking three peaks\ninto account. The results obtained are presented in Table 2.\nMultiple splittings of G-band modes were observed for individual\nMWCNTs by Zhao et al.,[36] who stated that for verifying the\nsymmetry assignments, polarised Raman scattering studies would\nbe needed. A polarised Raman study of aligned MWCNTs has\nbeen reported by Rao et al.[37] Furthermore, an interesting study\non the inﬂuence of the diameters in the Raman spectra of multi-\nwalled aligned CNTs has been very recently reported by Antunes\net al.[38]\nA further close examination of the MWCNT data presented\nin Table 2 reveals a marked difference between the MWCNT\nand the ﬁlter varieties. A small difference between the Aldrich\nMWCNT and the two ﬁlter varieties is that the G-bands in the\nAldrich MWCNT exhibit a small dispersive behaviour, whereas\nMWCNTI and MWCNTII show almost no dispersion with the\nchange in the excitation wavelength. The dispersive nature of\nthe G-band is associated with the Kohn anomaly effect, which\nis more pronounced in the case of metallic tubes. However,\nthis aspect is under very active study, but it is still not well\nunderstood. The positions of the three peaks are found at\n1568, 1584, and 1610 cm−1 with 532-nm excitation wavelength.\nHowever, these three peaks are shifted to 1580, 1590 and\n1615 cm−1 in MWCNTI and to 1581, 1592 and 1624 cm−1 in\nthe case of MWCNTII. Furthermore, the ratio ID/IG, where ID\nand IG are the intensities of the D- and G-bands, is also\npresented in Table 2 for each carbonaceous material. In the\ncase of the MWCNT commercial sample, the three peaks are\nrelatively narrow at 532-nm excitation wavelength, while for\nboth MWCNTI and MWCNTII ﬁlters, these peaks are slightly\nbroader.\nSurprisingly, the Raman spectra of the Carbotrap material also\nshow a spectral feature similar to that of CNTs. There is a trend\nwith the highest frequency band component appearing more\nprominently when one follows the series MWCNTI, MWCNTII and\nporous carbon black sample. The prominence of the G+ −G−\ndoublet is more evident in the spectra obtained with 785-nm\nexcitation. The intensities of D- and G-bands and their positions\nin the cases of the MWCNT and Carbotrap materials change with\nexcitation laser wavelength, whereas the G-band in our graphite\nJ.

The G′-band in the Raman spectra of all the carbonaceous\nmaterials, with both 532 and 785-nm excitation wavelengths,\nmainly shows a double band nature with a few exceptions, and\nthey are analysed taking two peaks into consideration. The results\nof this ﬁtting have been presented in Table 3. In a recent study\nby Shimada et al.,[39] the origin of the 2450 cm−1 Raman band in\nhighly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), single-wall and double-\nwallcarbonnanotubeshasbeendiscussed.Thebandat2450 cm−1\nshows no dispersion, whereas the G′-band is highly dependent\non Elaser. However, we have concentrated mainly on MWCNTs,\nwhere the 2450 cm−1 band could not be seen in the measured\nspectra. A more detailed study is perhaps required to explore this\nRaman band. In a more recent study also, Barros et al.[40] have\nextended their Raman study for characterising graphitic foams,\nwherein by analysing the dependence of the G′ band line shape\non the excitation energy, it was found that the G′ band line shape\nwas strongly correlated with the presence of stacking faults.\nThe G′-peak observed in the Raman spectra of all the\ncarbonaceous materials, which is basically the second harmonic of\nthe D1-band, appears at ∼2ωD wavenumber position, when sp2\nbonded carbon atoms are present.[6,35] This peak exhibits a strong\ndispersivebehaviourasafunctionofexcitationenergy.Theintense\nband of the analysed SWCNTs spectrum shows a shift of 44 cm−1\nupon change of excitation wavelength from 532 to 785 nm. On\nthe other hand, the most intense band of MWCNTs shows a shift of\n∼85 cm−1 upon increasing the excitation wavelength. This clearly\nimplies that the MWCNT materials are showing a strong dispersive\nnature compared to the SWCNT material investigated.\nThe double peak nature in the G′-peak has been explained in\nterms of double resonance process in which the electronic energy\nstate matches with the excitation energy.[6] In 2D graphite, the\nD-band originates from the TO phonon branch close to the K point\nin the Brillouin zone. Both D- and G′-peaks are sensitive to the\ndiameter and chirality of the CNTs. Apart from this, the features\nof the D- and G′- bands are found to change according to how\nthe 2D electronic phonon structure is folded into a 1D structure.\nAlong with the dependence on diameter and chirality of the tube,\nit also shows a strong dependence on excitation wavelength\nin the present study. The double peak nature of the G′-mode\narises from the Van Hove singularities occurring at the electronic\njoint density of states.[6,21,41] The two peaks in the G′-band for\nSWCNTs and MWCNTs arise because of the resonance with two\ndifferent Van Hove singularities of the same nanotube occurring\nindependently for both the incident and scattered photons. The\norigin of G′-peaks, as shown in Figs 4(b) and 5(b) can be associated\nwith phonon modes corresponding to the wave vector q = 2k.\nIn the 3D carbonaceous materials, say graphite, the double peak\nnature of G′-band is due to inter-layer coupling.[6] However, this\nmechanism is not applicable for SWCNTs and MWCNTs, since they\ndo not basically possess a 3D structure.\nConclusions\nThe Raman spectra of different carbonaceous materials were\nrecorded using two different excitation wavelengths, and the\nmost prominent band structures are analysed and compared. The\nD-band in the Raman spectra of different carbonaceous materials,\nwhich results because of disorder and symmetry lowering, exhibits\na signiﬁcant dispersive behaviour with change of excitation\nwavelength. The G-band of the carbonaceous materials except\ngraphite consists of six modes. For each symmetrical mode in the\nnanotubes, the vibration of atoms is either along the tube axis or\nalong the circumferential direction, which is designated as G+ or\nG−bands, respectively. In case of SWCNTs, these two components\nare ﬁtted using a Lorentzian line shape function, where the broad\nband feature essentially conﬁrms that the SWCNTs used in the\npresent study are predominantly semi-conducting in nature. The\nG- and D2- bands of the other materials are also investigated for\ntheir dispersive behaviour with a closer look at the MWCNT and\nCarbotrap species. The stable Raman shift position of the triplet\nband system for the MWCNT ﬁlter species, nearly independent\nfrom the two-excitation wavelengths, is a unique result of our\ninvestigation. Further studies are under way, for which the range\nof laser wavelengths will be extended (e.g. 488 and 1064 nm).\nWhilestudyingthebandintensities,itwasfoundthattheG-band\nin the spectral features of the MWCNTI ﬁlter species dominated\nover the D-band for both excitation wavelengths, similar to that\nof the SWCNT varieties studied in this work.
