The first-order Raman \nspectrum exhibits two lines at 1582 cm -’ and at 1350 cm-‘. The observed ratio of the integrated intensity of these lines was \nfound to be different as compared to polycrystalline \ngraphite. The position and intensity of the line around 1350 cm-’ strongly \ndepend on the energy of the exciting laser line. This dispersion effect is again different from the dispersion in nanocrystalline \ngraphite. It is discussed in terms of a photoselective \nresonance process. Transmission \ninfrared spectra of the nanotubes show one \nbroad and asymmetric line at 1575 cm-’ and a weaker line at 868 cm-‘. \n1. Introduction \nSince the discovery of the successful production \nof \nbuckminster \nfullerene \nin macroscopic \nquantities, \nworldwide \nattention \nhas focused on the unique prop- \nerties of these molecules \n[ 11. The recent discovery of \neven larger fullerenes, \ngraphitic \nnanotubes \n[2] and \nonion-like \npolyhedra \n[ 3 1, has substantially \nincreased \nthe interest in this area. These new carbon materials \nare interesting \nboth from a scientific and technologi- \ncal point of view. There might be practical \napplica- \ntions in such diverse \nareas as high tensile \nstrength \nfibres, molecular \nwires and solenoids \n[ 4 1. The basic \nstructure of nanotubes \nconsists of one or usually more \ngraphitic \nsheets wrapped around \none another with a \nhollow core. The caps are usually closed by the pres- \nence of carbon pentagons. \nConsequently, \nthe tubes \ncontain no dangling bonds. This is an intrinsic \ndiffer- \nence to graphite crystallites \nwhere open bonds are at \nthe edges. Due to this difference and due to the curved \nnature of the graphitic \nsheets in the tubes character- \nistically \ndifferent \nvibrational \nproperties \ncan be ex- \npected. However, the difference \nto the properties \nof \ngraphite crystallites \nmight be rather small since both \nmaterials \nare nanoparticles. \nMoreover, \nthe deviation \nfrom planarity \nis low in the graphitic sheets of a typ- \nical tube with more than a few nanometer \ndiameter. \nMonocrystalline \ngraphite belongs to the D&, space- \ngroup symmetry \n[ 5-91. The irreducible \nrepresenta- \ntion for the zone center optical modes is given by \nr,,,=2E,, \n(RI+&, \n(IR)+~Bz~+Az~ \n(IR) . \n(1) \nThe EZg modes are Raman active. One is a shear-type \nrigid-layer mode at 42 cm- ’ and the other an in-plane \nstretching mode at 1582 cm-’ often designated as the \nG mode. The infrared \noptical vibrations \nare an out- \nof-plane AZu mode at 868 cm-’ \nand an in-plane \nE,, \n0009-2614/94/$07.00 \n0 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Since this line is dis- \norder induced \nit is usually called the D line. Its sec- \nond-order \nis of considerable \nintensity \neven in mono- \ncrystalline \ngraphite \nbecause \nthe phonon \ndensity \nof \nstates has a maximum \nat 1350 cm-‘. \nSince the k=O \nselection \nrule does’not \napply for second-order \nRa- \nman scattering, \nphonons \ncan be observed \nfrom any \npart of the Brillouin \nzone. \nRaman \nspectra \nof carbon \nnanotubes \n[ 10 ] and \nclosed-shell \ncarbon \nparticles \n[ 111 have been \nre- \nported. A strong resemblance \nto the Raman spectrum \nof graphite \nwas found. \nFor carbon \nnanotubes \nthe \nstrongest \nRaman \nline is down-shifted \nby 6 cm-’ \nto \n1574 cm-’ \nas compared \nto the Eze mode of mono- \ncrystalline \ngraphite. \nAdditionally, \na line at around \n1350 cm-’ and its overtone \nat 2687 cm-’ have been \nobserved. \nIn this Letter we present \na correlation \nof the Ra- \nman spectrum \nof carbon \nnanotubes \nto their struc- \ntural properties. \nDistinct \ndifferences between the res- \nonance Raman behavior of carbon nanotubes, \ncarbon \nmicrocrystallites \nand \nhighly \noriented \npyrolytic \ngraphite \n(HOPG) \nare discussed within a photoselec- \ntive resonance \npicture. Finally, infrared \n(IR) spectra \nare presented \nand elucidated. \n2. Experimental \nThe technique \nused to produce \ncarbon nanotubes \nis similar \nto the one required \nfor the production \nof \nfullerenes \nby using a steel fullerene \ngenerator. \nAn 8 \nmm graphite \nrod of 99.99% purity \nand a plug of \ngraphite were used as the positive and as the negative \nelectrode, \nrespectively. \nThe generator \nwas flushed \nwith helium \nthree times before evacuating \nto 450 \nTorr. A dc potential \nof 27 V was applied between the \ntwo graphite \nrods. After the positive \nelectrode \nwas \nconsumed \na cylinder \nwith a grey outer layer and a \nblack inner core was found on the negative electrode. \nThis cylinder \nwas placed in methanol \nand sonicated \nfor ten minutes. This removed some of the inner black \nmaterial \nfrom the cylinder \nto give a fine black sus- \npension. \nAfter evaporating \nmethanol \na fine black \npowder was obtained \ncontaining \napproximately \n70% \nnanoparticles \nof which nanotubes \nare by far the most \nabundant. \nThis was proven by high-resolution \nelec- \ntron microscopy \n(HREM). \nDue to the high tube con- \ncentration \nit can be assumed that the Raman spectra \nare dominated \nby lines from the tubes. The rest of the \nmaterial \nconsisted \nof a fused mixture \nof tubes and \npolyhedra, \nand of amorphous \ncarbon. \nNo graphitic \ncrystallites \nwere observed. \nThe nanotubes \nshowed a \ndistribution \nin length and diameter. \nEvaluating \nthe \nelectron micrographs \nyielded a distribution \nas shown \nin Fig. 1. For the length an effective value is plotted \nwhere the graphitic planes are not interrupted \nby dis- \nlocations \nor breaks. Both values, the length and the \ndiameter, \nshow a bimodal \ndistribution \npeaking at 30 \nand 70 nm and 60 and 180 nm for the diameters \nand \nfor the lengths, respectively. \nMore detailed results of \nthe HREM \nmeasurements \nwill be published \nelse- \nwhere [ 121. \nRaman spectroscopy \nwas performed \nusing a Dilor \nXY spectrometer \nwith a liquid-nitrogen \ncooled CCD \ndetector. \nAs excitation \nsources \nAr+, \nKr+ \nand \na \nTi: sapphire laser with wavelengths \nranging from 457 \nup to 742 nm have been used. The measurements \nwere taken in back-scattering \ngeometry with a typical \nlaser power of 1 mW ( 140 W/cm’) \nand a spectral \nresolution \nof 2-4 cm-‘. \nLine positions \nand widths \nwere obtained \nfrom a numerical \nfit using Lorentzian \n60 \n80 \n100 \nDiameter \n(nm) \n0 \n100 \n200 \n300 \n400 \nEffective \nlength \n(nm) \nFig. 1.

When conducting IR spectroscopy a \nmixture of 300 mg KBr and several milligrams of car- \nbon nanotubes or graphite microcrystallites \nwere \nprepared in pellet form. The pellets were placed in a \nBruker IRS 66V spectrometer \nand transmittance \nspectra were taken between 400 and 5000 cm-’ with \na resolution of 2 cm-‘. IR spectra of highly oriented \npyrolytic graphite (HOPG) were taken from cleaved \nsurfaces in reflexion 11” from normal incidence. \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1. Raman scattering \nFig. 2 shows Raman spectra in selected spectral re- \ngions of carbon nanotubes, graphite microcrystallites \nand HOPG after excitation with 457 nm. The strong- \nest Raman line of all three studied materials has its \nmaximum at 1582 cm- ‘. It is the above mentioned \nG line. The full width at half maximum (fwhm) of \nthis line is about 20-22 cm-’ for both nanotubes and \ngraphite crystallites which is only slightly higher than \nthat for HOPG (about 15- 18 cm-’ ). There is an ad- \nditional line at 1350 cm- ’ in the spectra of nano- \ntubes and graphite microcrystallites assigned as the \nD line in Fig. 2. This line has the same intensity in \nboth spectra. \nThe high-frequency part of the spectrum for all \nthree materials studied is dominated by a strong line \nD* at around 2700 cm-’ which is the second-order \nof the D line. In the spectrum of HOPG this line con- \nsists of a doublet structure whereas in the other two \n1200 \n1400 \n1600 \n” \n2700 \n2600 \n2900 \nRaman \nshift \n(cm-‘) \nFig. 2. Raman spectra of carbon nanotubes, graphite microcrys- \ntallites and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) as ex- \ncited with 457 nm. \ncases it is a single line. The D* line is much broader \nfor crystallites (fwhm z 7 1 cm-’ ) and up-shifted \n(~~2742 \ncm-‘) \nas compared \nto \nnanotubes \n(fwhmz.9 \ncm-’ and v=2734 cm-‘). In addition, \nthere are several weak lines at 2455, 2955 and 3252 \ncm- ’ in the second-order Raman spectra of all three \nmaterials. Since these lines are similar in shape and \nposition for all studied materials they will not be dis- \ncussed further. Raman lines at 100 and 860 cm- ’ as \ncalculated by Al-Jishi et al. [ 131 could not be ob- \nserved. These new modes were predicted for tubes \nwith a diameter of 2 nm. Since all observed tubes in \nour sample have a considerably large diameter, these \nadditional Raman modes are expected to have van- \nishing intensity. In order to find the new nanotube \nmodes future studies must concentrate on smaller \ntubes. \nThe D line is of considerable diagnostic signifi- \ncance because the ratio between its integrated inten- \nsity and the integrated intensity of the G line (R = Z,/ \nZ,) depends on the structure of the studied carbon \nmaterial. The in-plane graphite crystallite size L can \nbe related to this ratio as [ 5-7 ] \nL (nm)=4.4?. \n(2) \nThis relation is valid for 0.00 1 <R < 1 and for laser \nexcitation between 488 and 5 14 nm. Since in our case \nR is 0.23 and thus in the range of validity of Eq. (2) \nthe latter gives a nanotube length of 20 nm. This is a \nfactor of 3 or 9 lower than the average obtained from \nHREM for the two peaks in the bimodal distribution. \nSince the concentration of contaminants like poly- \nhedra is very low in our samples, this discrepancy \nmust have structural reasons. We suggest the curved \nnature of the graphitic layers leads to an enhance- \nment of the D line due to an enhancement of the elec- \ntron-phonon coupling. Since it is generally accepted \nthat the electron-phonon \ncoupling increases by a o \nadmixture to the sp’ bonded carbon atoms the pres- \nent explanation seems plausible. Applying this inter- \npretation to lower and larger size tubes means that \nthe intensity of the D line will decrease with increas- \ning diameter of the carbon nanotubes and approach \nfor big tubes the value known from polycrystalline \ngraphite before it finally disappears. \nThere are two further parameters which correlate \nto the graphite crystallite size: the band widths of the \n",
    "56 \nJ. Kastner et al. /Chemical Physics Letters 221(1994) 53-58 \nG and D* lines [ 5,7]. The smaller width of the D* \nline for tubes as compared \nto the one for crystallites \nis in accordance \nwith the larger extension \nof the lat- \ntice along the direction \nof the tubes \n(nanotubes: \nL = 130 nm, graphite crystallites: L = 20 nm) and the \nenhancement \nof the D line for tubes due to their \ncurved nature. \nFrom these considerations \nit can be \nconcluded \nthat the D* width versus crystallite \nsize \ncorrelation \nis more or less identical \nfor carbon nano- \ntubes and polycrystalline \ngraphite. However, the same \nwidth of the G line in both materials is at a first glance \nin contradiction \nto their different \nsizes. In order to \nunderstand \nit one has to take into consideration \nthat \nthe curved nature of nanotubes \nand their interplane \ndisorder \nalso lead to a line broadening. \nHence the \nagreement \nof the widths for the G lines in tubes and \nin the crystallites \nis only by chance. The broadening \nmechanisms \nare completely \ndifferent. \nThe fact that \nonly the G line for tubes and not the D* line is broad- \nened might be related to the different origins of these \nlines. The G line is a zone center optical \nphonon, \nwhereas the D* line is the second-order \nof a non-cen- \nter phonon \n[ 7,9]. \nCalculations \nby Al-Jishi \nand \nDresselhaus \n[ 91 showed that the low-energy \nside of \nthe D* line dominantly \ncomes from the K point and \nthe high-energy \nside mainly from the M point. In the \ncase of monocrystalline \ngraphite and HOPG this gives \na doublet structure \nwith a shoulder at the low-energy \nside and in graphite \ncrystallites \na broadened \nsingle \nline. In carbon nanotubes \nthe D* line is almost at the \nsame position \nas the shoulder \nof the D* line for \nHOPG. \nThus, for carbon \nnanotubes \ncontributions \nfrom the region near a K derived point dominate \nthe \nD* line due to the particular \nstructure. \n3.2. Resonance Raman scattering \nIn Fig. 3 Raman \nspectra of carbon nanotubes \nex- \ncited with different laser lines are shown. The spectra \nare normalized \nto equal height of the G line. Ac- \ntually, the Raman intensity \nincreases from 1= 742 nm \nto A = 457 nm. The change of the signal to noise ratio \noriginates \nfrom the spectrometer \nresponse \nfunction \nwhich has a broad maximum \nbetween \n500 and 700 \nnm and is rather low at A= 457 nm. One can clearly \nsee that both the D and D* lines are shifted to lower \nwavenumbers \nwith increasing \nwavelength \nof the ex- \nciting laser whereas \nthe position \nof the G line re- \n1200 \n1400 \n1600 \n2600 \n2800 \nRaman \nshift \n(cm-‘) \nFig. 3.

In addi- \ntion, a new line at 1620 cm-’ \nappears in the spec- \ntrum after excitation with the yellow or red laser. This \nline was also observed \nin the spectrum \nof graphite \ncrystallites \nand similarly to the D line it was assigned \nto disorder-induced \nsymmetry \nbreaking \nby the mi- \ncroscopic \nparticle \nsize [ 14,151. As with the D line \nthe phonon \ndensity of states has a maximum \nat this \nenergy. For the case of the tubes the disorder \norigi- \nnates from the finite tube size and thus the interpre- \ntation for the origin of the line corresponds. \nFig. 4a shows explicitly the Raman shift of the D* \nline with the energy of the exciting laser line for all \nthree studied samples. For HOPG only the position \n",
    "J, Kastner et al. /Chemical Physics Letters 221(1994) 53-58 \n51 \nof the high-energy \nline of the doublet is plotted. The \nD* line shift to higher wavenumbers \nis by about 15% \nweaker for carbon nanotubes \nas compared \nto graph- \nite crystallites. \nThe change of the relative intensities \nwith the energy of the exciting laser is significant. \nThe \nD line is much stronger as compared \nto the G line for \nexcitation \nwith the red laser as compared \nto excita- \ntion with the green or blue laser (Fig. 3). This is \ndemonstrated \nin Fig. 4b. Here the intensity \nratios of \nthe D line to the G line are plotted versus the energy \nof the exciting laser for nanotubes \nand microcrystal- \nlites. This ratio decreases non-linearly \nwith increas- \ning laser energy and behaves characteristically \ndiffer- \nent for tubes and graphite crystallites. \nA dependence \nof the Raman shift of a mode on the \nenergy of the exciting laser is formally \ncalled a dis- \npersion \neffect. There are several possible \nexplana- \ntions for this behavior. \nIt might be related to a probing \nof the sample at \ndifferent depths below the surface as known from in- \norganic semiconductors \n[ 16 1. This would require a \ndepletion \nof carriers at the surface to the depth of the \npenetrating \nlight. Since the tubes studied \nhere are \nrather large they have a narrow electronic gap [ 41 and \nthus at room temperature \na high carrier concentra- \ntion. This situation \nis not compatible \nwith a large de- \npletion \ndepth \nwhich \nconsequently \nrules \nout this \nmechanism. \nThe dispersion \nmight then be rather attributed \nto a \nphotoselective \nresonance \nprocess. \nTwo \ndifferent \nmechanisms \nare possible for the tubes. \nSimilarly, as in conjugated \npolymers and sp-bonded \nlinear \ncarbon \nmolecules \n[ 17-191 \nforce constants, \nfrequencies \nand electronic transitions \nmay depend on \nthe size of the nanotubes. \nBy measuring \nwith differ- \nent laser energies one is probing selectively \ndifferent \nparts of the sample and the overall response gives the \nresulting \nline shape and line position. \nCalculations \nshowing an increase in the band gap with decreasing \nsize for at least some of the tubes \n[4] are in agree- \nment with this hypothesis. \nHowever, within this pic- \nture the independence \nof the line shift on the crystal- \nlite size is hard to explain. Therefore, \nanother model \nmay work better. The line shifting can be related to \nthe dispersion \nof the D phonon \nat the Brillouin \nzone \nedge at the M and IS derived points [ 141. Excitations \nwith different \nlaser energies will result in different \nresonance \nenhancements \nof the contributions \nfrom \nregions near the K and M derived \npoints to the D \nline. \nIn both photoselective \nresonance \npictures the spe- \ncial electronic \nstructure \nof carbon \nnanotubes \nac- \ncounts for the difference \nin the dispersion \nas com- \npared to graphite. \nA change in the IDjIG ratio with the energy of the \nexciting \nlaser for different \nforms of polycrystalline \ngraphitic \nmaterials \nwas already observed \nby several \nauthors \n[ 14,20,21]. \nIt was attributed \nto a stronger \nresonance \nenhancement \nof the G line as compared \nto \nthe D line [ 2 11. By excitation \nwith a red laser one is \nfar away from the n-rc* transition \n(4-5 eV) and the \nG line is no longer more enhanced \nas compared \nto \nthe D line. Applying \nthis model to the results pre- \nsented here reveals a difference \nin the resonance \nRa- \nman profile for graphite and carbon nanotubes. \nThis \nshows again that the electronic \nstructure \nof carbon \nnanotubes \nis characteristically \ndifferent \nfrom graph- \nite and graphite microcrystallites. \n3.3.

The IR spectra for both carbon nanotubes \nand \ngraphite \ncrystallites \nare different \nfrom the one for \nHOPG, \nbut resemble \neach other strongly. \nThe Alu \nmode is at the same position as in HOPG whereas the \nEl, mode is softened to about 1575 cm- ’ and consid- \nerably broadened \nwith an asymmetric \ntail in the low- \nenergy region. \nThe shift of the E,, mode can have several reasons. \nFirstly, a change of the interplane \nbonding \nleads to a \nchange of the E,, line because its energy is associated \nwith an interlayer \nforce constant. \nMoreover, \nintro- \nduced disorder \nand finite size effects may lead to a \nline broadening \nand shifting \nas well. Finally, \nthe \nbending \nof the graphitic \nsheets might lead also to the \nsame effect. Probably \nall mechanisms \ncontribute \nto \nthe observed shape and position \nof the El, mode. \n4. Conclusion \nCarbon nanotubes \nhave been characterized \nby high- \nresolution \nelectron \nmicroscopy, \nresonance \nRaman \nand IR spectroscopy. \nIt has been shown that the Z,/ \nZG ratio versus the in-plane \ngraphite sheet size of car- \nbon nanotubes \nis different \nfrom the corresponding \nrelation in polycrystalline \ngraphite. Due to the curved \nnature \nof the graphitic \nsheets the electron-phonon \ncoupling constant \nand therefore also the D line is en- \nhanced. A dispersion \nand resonance \neffect was found \nfor the D line. The discrepancy \nbetween carbon nan- \notubes and graphite microcrystallites \nhas been attrib- \nuted to different \nresonance \nRaman profiles and their \ndifferent \nelectronic \nstructure. \nIR spectra of carbon \nnanotubes \nhave been presented. \nThe difference to the \nspectrum \nof HOPG has been explained \nby disorder \ninduced \nline broadening \nand softening. \nAcknowledgement \nThis work was supported \nby the Osteuropa \nFijrde- \nrung des BMfWF project GZ 45.2 12/2-27b9 1.
