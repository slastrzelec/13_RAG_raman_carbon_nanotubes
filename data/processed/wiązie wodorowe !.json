Moruzzi 1, I-56124 Pisa, Italy\n*\nS Supporting Information\nABSTRACT: Hydrogen-bonding interactions lead to signiﬁcant\nchanges in the infrared (IR) spectrum, like frequency shifts of the\norder of magnitude of hundreds of cm−1 and increases of IR\nintensity for bands related to vibrational modes of functional\ngroups directly involved in the hydrogen-bonded bridges. We are\nactively developing a comprehensive and robust computational\nprotocol aimed at the quantitative reproduction of the spectra of\nbio-organic and hybrid organic/inorganic molecular systems with\na proper account of the variety of intra- and intermolecular\ninteractions. We have resorted to fully anharmonic quantum\nmechanical computations within the generalized second-order\nvibrational perturbation theory (GVPT2) approach, combined\nwith the B3LYP-D3 method, in conjunction with basis sets of\ndouble-ζ plus polarization quality. Such an approach has been validated in a previous work (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2014, 16,\n10112−10128) for simulating the IR spectra of the monomers of nucleobases and some of their dimers. In the present\ncontribution we have extended our computational protocol toward hybrid models, with the harmonic part computed at the\nB2PLYP level, in conjunction with the maug-cc-pVTZ basis set, or by a cost-eﬀective ONIOM B2PLYP:B3LYP focused model,\nwhere only part of the molecular system forming the hydrogen bonds is treated at the B2PLYP level of theory. In this work\nexperimental frequencies available for a set of four uracil−water complexes have been considered as references for the\ncomputational methodologies applied to the simulation of hydrogen-bonding eﬀects on the infrared spectrum, obtaining average\nuncertainties of about 22 cm−1 for B3LYP-D3/N07D and improved description within 10 cm−1 by hybrid B2PLYP/B3LYP-D3\napproaches. The same computational schemes have been next applied to simulate fully anharmonic IR spectra of six diﬀerent\nhydrogen-bonded uracil dimers, providing reliable support for future experimental investigations on hydrogen-bonded systems.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nComputational spectroscopy techniques play an increasing role\nin the study of the physical and chemical properties of complex\nsystems dominated by diﬀerent kinds of intermolecular\ninteractions, because they allow us to dissect the various\ncontributions to the spectroscopic signals, shedding light on the\nintricate experimental data.1−12 Among the weak intermolec-\nular interactions, hydrogen bonding acts as important factor in\nseveral ﬁelds, ranging from materials science, nanotechnology,\nand surface science to biotechnology, drug design and delivery,\nand prebiotic chemistry.13−23 Especially in biological systems,\nthe formation of strong hydrogen bonds can be a crucial driving\nforce for many fundamental processes like protein folding and\nmisfolding or the biological information transfer mechanisms\nby nucleic acids.24−27 In the prebiotic context, hydrogen-\nbonding interactions play a fundamental role in the processes of\nself-organization and self-interaction of biomolecules, which in\nturn are responsible for the evolution from the inanimate\nmatter to the biological systems.28 In particular, nucleobases are\nvery interesting chemical systems that can interact through\nhydrogen bonds, capable of self-assembling forming dimers,\nmonolayers,or more complex three-dimensional structures.29,30\nReceived:\nFebruary 15, 2015\nRevised:\nApril 12, 2015\nPublished: April 13, 2015\nArticle\npubs.acs.org/JPCA\n© 2015 American Chemical Society\n4224\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.5b01561\nJ.

    "Recently, nucleobases have attracted increasing interest also for\nthe development of biosensors,31−34 and as biomaterials\nforming nanostructures for homogeneous dense surface\ncoatings, bottom-up nanopatterning, and 3D nanoparticle\nlattices.35\nThe hydrogen-bonded complexes of nucleobases with water\nor their dimers represent the simplest systems for studying the\neﬀect of hydrogen-bonding interactions on physicochemical\nproperties like the vibrational features (see, for example, refs 26\nand 36−43 and references therein). From the computational\npoint of view, these systems are small enough to allow the use\nof accurate quantum mechanical (QM) methods for investigat-\ning vibrational properties beyond the harmonic approximation,\nwithin the second-order vibrational perturbative (VPT2)44,45 or\nvibrational self-consistent ﬁeld (VSCF) based46−49 approaches.\nIn particular, our group has developed a general VPT2\nframework to compute thermodynamic properties, vibrational\nenergies, and transition intensities from the vibrational ground\nstate to fundamentals, overtones and combination bands,50,51\nallowing also for eﬀective computations of large molecular\nsystems within reduced-dimensionality schemes.52 The in-\nformation about the intensities of overtones and combination\ntransitions, not available from computations based on the\ndouble-harmonic approximation, is required to reproduce the\noverall band pattern and might be necessary to correctly\nanalyze experimental outcomes, distinguishing low-intensity\nfeatures related to nonfundamental transitions of the most\npopulated species present in experimental mixtures from\nfundamental transitions of the less abundant ones.12,53−57\nIt is worth noting that quite remarkable eﬀects of hydrogen-\nbonding interactions on the infrared (IR) spectrum are usually\nobserved experimentally.58−60 Indeed, the red shift and\nintensity enhancement in the X−H stretching frequency\nfollowing X−H···Y hydrogen bond formation are included\namong the criteria based on spectroscopy in recent IUPAC\ndeﬁnition for hydrogen bond formation.61 A reliable theoretical\ndescription of the relative spectroscopic features is highly\ndesirable to correctly interpret experimental outcomes.43,62\nHowever, the vibrational treatment of hydrogen-bonded\nsystems is particularly demanding, due to enhanced anharmo-\nnicity and accuracy requirements of the underlying potential\nenergy surface (PES).63\nIn a previous work43 we have studied the IR spectroscopic\nproperties of the isolated nucleobases adenine, hypoxanthine,\nuracil, thymine, and cytosine, and some of the most stable\nhydrogen-bonded and stacked dimers of adenine and uracil,\nidentifying a general, reliable, and eﬀective computational\nprocedure based on fully anharmonic QM computations of the\nvibrational wavenumbers and IR intensities through the\ngeneralized second-order vibrational perturbation theory\n(GVPT2) approach.12,51 The VPT2 model is particularly\nappealing for treating medium-size semirigid systems when\ncombined with a semidiagonal fourth-order normal mode\nrepresentation of the anharmonic force ﬁeld evaluated by\nmeans of density functional theory (DFT) using hybrid\nfunctionals in conjunction with polarized double-ζ basis sets\n(see, for instance, ref 12 and references therein). Fully\nanharmonic computations employing B3LYP64 functional in\nconjunction with N07D65 or SNSD12 basis sets have been\nextensively validated for the prediction of vibrational\nfrequencies with the accuracy necessary for a quantitative\ncomparison with experimental data for systems of increasing\nsize and complexity (see, for instance, refs 12, 66, and 67 and\nreferences therein). Several recent results demonstrate that fully\nanharmonic computations at the VPT2 level provide also\nrealistic IR spectral band shapes12,68 as well as reliable IR\nintensities of fundamental transitions, overtones, and combina-\ntion bands.69 Moreover, it has been shown that the inclusion of\na semiempirical dispersion treatment70 improves the accuracy\nof structural parameters and binding energies for systems\ninvolving dispersion interactions,71−73 retaining the same\naccuracy of the noncorrected methods for the anharmonic\nfrequencies.12,42,43,72 In particular, the B3LYP-D3/SNSD\nmethod has been used to study the hydrogen-bonded and\nstacked dimers of adenine and uracil, showing energy properties\nin very good agreement with the best theoretical estimates and\nproviding much better predictions of binding energies and\nstructural parameters than B3LYP/SNSD, not only for stacked\nstructures but also for hydrogen-bonded dimers.43 The\npseudopotential based (DCP) method B3LYP-DCP/6-31+G-\n(2d,2p)74 has shown very good performance for structural\nparameters and binding energies of nucleobases dimers as well,\nbut a lower accuracy for vibrational properties. However,\nB3LYP-DCP/6-31+G(2d,2p) has been shown to outperform\nseveral other dispersion-corrected DFT approaches for\ncalculating anharmonic vibrational frequencies, and to provide\nreliable anharmonic corrections.43 Therefore, in addition to\nB3LYP-D3/N07D, we have considered also B3LYP-DCP/6-\n31+G(2d,2p) (using the new parameters developed by DiLabio\nand co-workers75) for calculating anharmonic vibrational\nproperties. Moreover, improved description of the overall\nanharmonic frequencies has been achieved through a hybrid\nscheme12,76,77 in which the harmonic part of the force-ﬁeld is\ncomputed at a higher level of theory, namely with the double-\nhybrid B2PLYP functional78,79 in conjunction with the maug-\ncc-pVTZ basis set.80 Within hybrid approaches we have\nconsidered also improved description of harmonic frequencies\nfor modes involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions through\ncost-eﬀective ONIOM B2PLYP:B3LYP computations. Exper-\nimental frequencies available for a set of four uracil−water\ncomplexes have been considered as references for validation of\nthe computational methodologies that provide the best\ndescription of the eﬀect of hydrogen-bonding interactions on\nthe IR spectrum. Then, fully anharmonic infrared spectra of six\nhydrogen-bonded uracil dimers have been simulated, high-\nlighting the inﬂuence of diﬀerent bonding patterns on the\noverall IR spectra line shapes and the ﬁngerprint features of the\nspeciﬁc hydrogen-bonding interactions. In fact, the theoretical\ninfrared spectra simulated in the present work allow us to go\nbeyond simpliﬁed analysis of experimental data based on\nharmonic approximation40 and support future experimental\ninvestigations.\n2. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\nAnharmonic vibrational computations have been performed by\na generalization of the well-known VPT2 model44,45,50,51,81−105\nimplemented by some of the present authors in the\nGAUSSIAN suite of programs50,51,90,91,101,105 and able to\ncompute thermodynamic and kinetic properties, vibrational\nenergies, and transition intensities from the vibrational ground\nstate to fundamentals, overtones, and combination bands. The\nsemidiagonal quartic force ﬁelds have been obtained by\nnumerical diﬀerentiation of the analytical second derivatives\nalong each active normal coordinate (with the standard 0.01 Å\nstep) at geometries optimized with tight convergence criteria.\nFermi resonances have been treated within the generalized\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry A\nArticle\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.5b01561\nJ.

    "VPT2 scheme (GVPT2), where the nearly resonant contribu-\ntions are removed from the perturbative treatment (leading to\nthe deperturbed model, DVPT2) and variationally treated in a\nsecond step.50,85,90,92 This model50,90,91 provided accurate\nvibrational wavenumbers for several semirigid sys-\ntems.12,43,66,106−111 Such an approach relies on semiempirical\nthresholds for ﬁrst-order resonances. In the present work, the\ncriteria proposed by Martin et al.92 for Fermi resonances have\nbeen chosen as they provide accurate results for fundamental\ntransitions,12,111 overtones, and combination bands.57,105,112\nRecently, the method has been extended to compute\nanharmonic IR, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and\nRaman intensities for the fundamentals, overtones, and\ncombination bands.12,51,101,105 The computation of IR\nintensities within the DVPT2 model employs thresholds for\n1−1 resonances ranging between 2 and 10 cm−1, to get\nconverged results.\nIn a ﬁrst step, geometry optimizations followed by harmonic\nand anharmonic vibrational calculations at various levels of\ntheory were performed for a set of four uracil−water complexes\nused as benchmark. The calculations have been performed\nusing B3LYP,64 B3LYP-D3,70,113 B3LYP-DCP,74,114−116 and\nM06-2X117 hybrid functionals in conjunction with double-ζ\nplus polarization basis sets. The N07D65,118−120 basis set has\nbeen applied for B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, and M06-2X computa-\ntions, whereas the 6-31+G(2d,2p) basis set has been applied for\nB3LYP-DCP, as recommended by DiLabio.74 Anharmonic\ncomputations have been also performed with hybrid\nmodels,12,69,76,77,79,109,121 in which the harmonic part is\ncomputed at double-hybrid B2PLYP78,79 level of theory and\nthe anharmonic corrections are evaluated by less expensive\nB3LYP-D3 or B3LYP-DCP approaches. In view of previous\nexperience on increased basis-set requirements,68,69,79,122,123 all\nthe B2PLYP computations have been performed with maug-cc-\npVTZ basis set80 in which d functions on hydrogens have been\nremoved. Moreover, considering that for larger systems (i.e.,\nuracil dimers) harmonic frequency calculations at the B2PLYP\nlevel can be already computationally too demanding, we have\ntested the performance of a two-layer ONIOM124,125\nB2PLYP:B3LYP scheme (abbreviated as B2:B3) in which the\nmodel system (high level, B2PLYP) corresponds to the part of\nmolecular system directly involved in the hydrogen-bonding\ninteraction, with the whole complex taken as the real system\n(lower level, B3LYP). Partitioning within the uracil monomer,\nleading to the deﬁnition of the model system, has been always\nperformed along a formally single bond. In total, four diﬀerent\npartitioning schemes (1−2, 2−3, 3−4, and 4−6) have been\ndeﬁned (Figure 1). For each B2:B3 ONIOM model harmonic\nfrequencies of the uracil monomer show good agreement with\ntheir B2PLYP counterparts (Supporting Information). Further\nvalidations, including comparison with experimental data, have\nbeen performed for uracil−water complexes, in which the water\nmolecule has been included in the model system. Detailed\ndescription of all computational models has been gathered in\nTable 1, along with corresponding labels.\nThen, geometry optimizations together with harmonic and\nanharmonic vibrational calculations have been carried out also\nfor six hydrogen-bonded uracil dimers applying B3D3 and\nB2:B3 levels of theory. The structures and numbering schemes\nof the uracil−water complexes and uracil dimers considered in\nthis work, optimized at the B3LYP-D3/N07D level of theory,\nare shown in Figure 2, and the corresponding coordinates are\nreported in the Supporting Information. The binding energies\nof uracil dimers have been computed at B3LYP-D3/N07D level\nof theory as diﬀerences between the total energies of the\noptimized dimer structures and the sums of the total energies of\nthe isolated monomers, taking into account the basis set\nsuperposition error (BSSE) via counterpoise correction\n(CP).126 Then, such counterpoise-corrected binding energies\nhave been compared to the best theoretical reference values,\nwhen available, computed at CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory\nand reported in the Supporting Information.127,128\nAll calculations have been carried out employing the\nGAUSSIAN suite of programs.129 Assignments of vibrational\nmodes were performed by means of visual inspection of the\natomic displacements along normal modes and by comparison\nwith the assignments reported in the literature. A graphical user\ninterface (VMS-Draw)130 has been used to visualize normal\nmodes, analyze in detail the outcome of vibrational\ncomputations and draw IR spectra.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1. Validation of the Computational Method: Uracil−\nWater Complexes. The set of four uracil−water complexes\nhas been used to benchmark the computational methodologies\nfor simulating the infrared spectroscopic features of hydrogen-\nbonded systems where strong hydrogen bonds between proton\ndonor and acceptor moieties take place. The availability of the\ncarefully assigned experimental frequencies for isolated uracil−\nwater complexes41 in the spectral range of NH and OH\nstretching vibrations allows to assess the performance of\ndiﬀerent methods in predicting anharmonic vibrational\nfrequencies of functional groups involved in hydrogen-bonding\ninteractions.\nThe anharmonic vibrational frequencies of the most stable\nuracil−water complex (complex 1) have been computed at B3,\nB3D3, B3DCP, M06-2X and hybrid B2/B3D3, B2/B3DCP,\nand B2:B3 levels of theory (see Table 1 for acronyms).\nMoreover, harmonic vibrational frequencies have been\ncomputed also with the B2PLYP and ONIOM B2:B3 approach.\nTable 2 reports harmonic and anharmonic OH and NH\nstretching vibrational frequencies, which are mainly inﬂuenced\nby the hydrogen-bonding interactions, in comparison with their\nexperimental counterparts. The best theoretical description of\nthe eﬀect of hydrogen bonding on the vibrational frequencies\nhas been obtained with the hybrid B2/B3D3 and B2:B3\napproaches, providing mean absolute errors (MAEs) with\nrespect to experiment of about 10 cm−1, and maximum\ndiscrepancies well below 20 cm−1, further conﬁrming the\naccuracy of the anharmonic shifts computed with the B3LYP-\nD3 method.

    "tions (B2/B3DCP model) leads to slightly worse results, with\nMAE of 16 cm−1 and maximum discrepancy exceeding 30 cm−1.\nAmong the less expensive methods used in this work, M06-\n2X yields the worst results, with a MAE of 67 cm−1, whereas the\nB3LYP-based approaches provide better predictions, with\nMAEs of 31, 25, and 44 cm−1 in the case of B3LYP, B3LYP-\nD3, and B3LYP-DCP, respectively. In particular, B3LYP-D3\noutperforms B3LYP-DCP in calculating the harmonic part of\nthe overall anharmonic frequencies, whereas both methods are\nroughly equally reliable in the prediction of the anharmonic\nshifts, as already shown in a previous work.43\nThus, we have focused only on B3LYP-D3 and B3LYP-DCP\nmethods for computing anharmonic vibrational frequencies of\nthe other less stable uracil−water complexes (complexes 2−4)\nreported in Table 3, considering as references for anharmonic\ncomputations the hybrid B2/B3D3, B2/B3DCP, and B2:B3\napproaches, given their high accuracy compared to the\nexperiment.

    "accurate results with respect to B3DCP, with MAEs of 15, 29,\nand 19 cm−1 for complexes 2, 3, and 4, respectively, instead of\n30, 43, and 34 cm−1, which can be essentially attributed to\nimprovements in the harmonic part. Indeed, the quite similar\nMAEs obtained using the hybrid B2/B3D3 and B2/B3DCP\nmethods point out the comparable performance of B3LYP-D3\nand B3LYP-DCP in predicting the anharmonic corrections.\nMoreover, it is apparent that the hybrid B2:B3 model, in which\nthe most expensive B2PLYP computations are restricted to the\npart of molecular system directly involved in hydrogen bond\ninteraction, yields very accurate results, with MAEs of 8−12\ncm−1 and low maximum absolute deviations with respect to\nexperiments within a range of about 13−21 cm−1. This is due\nnot only to the reliability of the anharmonic shifts computed\nwith the B3LYP-D3/N07D method but also to the increased\naccuracy of the harmonic part computed through the ONIOM\nB2:B3 scheme, which is comparable to the accuracy of the full\nB2PLYP computations, at strongly reduced computational cost.\nResults of the anharmonic vibrational computations for the\nuracil−water complexes indicate that dispersion-corrected\nB3LYP-based methods are reliable enough for a quantitative\ncomparison with experiments, reproducing well also vibrations\ninvolved in hydrogen-bonded bridges that are characterized by\nmore anaharmonic PES with respect to those of the isolated\nmolecules.59,61,63 In particular, B3LYP-D3 yields more accurate\nresults with average uncertainties within 22 cm−1 in the spectral\nregion of hydrogen-bonding interactions. Although B3LYP-\nDCP/6-31+G(2d,2p) gives higher errors with an average MAE\nof 38 cm−1, it outperforms several other dispersion-corrected\nDFT approaches and provides reliable anharmonic corrections.\nIt is worth noting that scaling factors that take into account\nhydrogen bonding131 (0.9733 for ν(OH)free and 0.9602 for\nν(OH)-HB do not provide a balanced description of OH\nstretching vibrations in uracil−water complexes, with mode\nν(OH)free overestimated by up to 65 cm−1 and ν(OH)-HB)\nunderestimated by up to 32 cm−1, respectively. The need of a\nreliable yet not expensive computational method for predicting\nboth the harmonic part and the anharmonic correction to\nvibrational frequencies suggests B3LYP-D3/N07D as the\nmethod of choice.\nThen, a more accurate description of the anharmonic\nfrequencies is provided by hybrid computations where the\nharmonic part of the overall vibrational frequencies is\ncomputed at a higher level of theory like B2PLYP. However,\nto study larger and more complex systems, improved harmonic\nvibrational frequencies of functional groups involved in the\nhydrogen-bonding interactions may be obtained by application\nof the less demanding ONIOM B2:B3 scheme, which is a\nfocused model where only the part of the molecular system\nforming the hydrogen bonds is treated at the B2PLYP level of\ntheory and the remaining part is treated with B3LYP, obtaining\naverage uncertainties of about 10 cm−1 in the spectral region of\nhydrogen-bonding interactions.\n3.2. Eﬀect of Hydrogen-Bonding Interactions on the\nInfrared Spectrum: Uracil Dimers. Our previous works on\nnucleobase complexes have already highlighted the remarkable\neﬀects of intermolecular interactions, including hydrogen\nbonds, on the vibrational frequencies of the molecules.22,28,43,62\nIn the case of uracil in the solid state,22,132 such intermolecular\ninteractions are responsible for signiﬁcant red shifts of the\nvibrational frequencies with respect to uracil isolated in an\nargon matrix:133−135 about 400 cm−1 for the NH stretching\nmodes and 80 cm−1 for the stretching modes of the carbonyl\ngroups involved in the hydrogen bonds. These experimental\nshifts have been reproduced quite well theoretically by reduced\ndimensionality VPT2 approaches using the B3LYP-D3/N07D\nmethod, simulating a cluster of seven uracil molecules.62\nFor uracil monomer and the hydrogen-bonded uracil dimers,\na full VPT2 anharmonic treatment at B3D3 or B2:B3 levels is\nfeasible, allowing for an improved accuracy of computed\nvibrational frequencies. In the absence of hydrogen bonds, i.e.,\nin the case of the isolated uracil molecule, the accuracy of fully\nanharmonic VPT2 calculations using the B3LYP-D3/N07D\nmethod is particularly high, about 10 cm−1 (all harmonic and\nFigure 3.

Experimental IR spectrum recorded in the low-temperature Ar matrix has been generated using the data reported in\nref 133. IR spectral line shapes (both theoretical and experimental) have been convoluted using Lorentzian functions with a half-width at a half-\nmaximum (HWHM) of 1 cm−1.

The experimental features in\nthe 1600−1800 cm−1 spectral range, shown in the inset, are\nwell reproduced by anharmonic calculations, in particular taking\ninto account also the presence of relatively intense non-\nfundamental transitions. Anharmonic computations show, in\naddition to the two most intense bands corresponding to the\nCO stretching fundamentals and one weaker transition related\nto the ν(C5C6) mode, also ﬁve nonfundamental transitions. In\nline with experimental ﬁndings two of them are nearly as\nintense as the ν(C4O) fundamental. It should be noted that\nsuch a result could not be obtained by application of scaling\nfactors to the harmonic frequencies as in this case only the\nthree bands corresponding to the fundamental transitions are\npresent instead of complex pattern including also combination\nbands and overtones. These results further conﬁrm that\nGVPT2/DVPT2 anharmonic computations employing DFT\npotential energy surfaces provide qualitatively correct IR\nintensities of all transitions, largely suﬃcient to simulate\nrealistic band patterns. Whenever highly accurate IR intensities\nare needed, for example, for atmospheric or astrochemical\nstudies, quantitative results can be obtained by hybrid models\nFigure 4.

In particular, the NH modes\nare extremely sensitive to H-bonding, featuring signiﬁcant red\nshifts for the stretching vibrations and analogous blue shifts for\nthe out-of-plane bendings, as already observed in other\nTable 4.

This results in large red shifts for the corresponding\nvibrational modes, pointing out a weakening of the force\nconstants due to the hydrogen-bonding interactions, and a\ncorresponding increase of IR intensities. On the contrary, the\nout-of-plane bending modes of the N3H groups (at about 900\ncm−1) undergo a corresponding blue shift of about 250 cm−1.\nThe u2hb2 dimer, instead, features only one hydrogen bond\nbetween the N1H group of monomer 1 and the C4O group of\nmonomer 2, and another weaker interaction between the C2O\ngroup of monomer 1 and the C5H group of monomer 2. This\nis clearly spotted in the changes of the spectroscopic features,\nwith the most important red shifts of the vibrational frequencies\nof about 350 and 74 cm−1 concerning the ν(N1H) mode of\nmonomer 1 at 3124 cm−1 and ν(C4O) mode of monomer 2 at\n1686 cm−1, respectively, which correspond to the most intense\nIR bands in the spectrum as well. A blue shift of about 260\ncm−1 has been observed for the γ(N1H) vibration of monomer\n1 at about 827 cm−1. Another noteworthy red shift of about 50\ncm−1 has been observed for the ν(C5H) mode of monomer 2\nat 3072 cm−1, along with a less signiﬁcant 20 cm−1 red shift of\nthe ν(C2O) mode of monomer 1 at 1757 cm−1.\nThe u2hb3 dimer features two hydrogen bonds, one\ninvolving the C4O group of monomer 1 and the N1H group\nof monomer 2 and the other between the N3H group of\nmonomer 1 and the C2O group of monomer 2. This results in\ntwo strongly red-shifted, of about 500 cm−1, intermolecular\nmodes at 2962 and 2899 cm−1, corresponding to the\ncombination of modes ν(N3H) of monomer 1 and ν(N1H)\nof monomer 2, and red shifts of about 80 and 60 cm−1 for the\nν(C4O) band of monomer 1 at 1681 cm−1 and the ν(C2O)\nmode of monomer 2 at 1701 cm−1, respectively. Also in this\ncase, remarkable blue shifts (above 200 cm−1) have been\nobserved for the γ(NH) vibration involved in the hydrogen-\nbonds.\nThe u2hb4 dimer shows the largest red shifts, about 600\ncm−1, for the ν(N1H) vibration of both monomers at 2938 and\n2871 cm−1, as the result of the formation of two very strong\nhydrogen-bonds between the N1H and C2O groups of both\nmonomers. Analogously, the ν(C2O) bands of both monomers\nat 1711 and 1710 cm−1 present red shifts of about 70 cm−1.\nBlue shifts above 250 cm−1 have been observed for the γ(N1H)\nmode of both monomers as well.\nThe u2hb5 dimer has two hydrogen bonds involving the\nN3H groups of both monomers and the C2O group of\nmonomer 1 and C4O group of monomer 2, with corresponding\nred shifts of about 400 cm−1 for the modes ν(N3H) at 3054\nand 3002 cm−1, 65 cm−1 for the mode ν(C2O) of monomer 1\nat 1715 cm−1, 64 cm−1 for the mode ν(C4O) of monomer 2 at\n1696 cm−1, and blue shifts above 200 cm−1 for the γ(N3H)\nvibrations of both monomers.\nFinally, the u2hb6 dimer features only one hydrogen bond\nbetween the N3H group of monomer 1 and the C4O group of\nmonomer 2, and a weaker intermolecular interaction between\nthe C4O group of monomer 1 and the C5H group of monomer\n2, resulting in the most important red shifts of about 350 cm−1\nfor the ν(N3H) mode of monomer 1 at 3081 cm−1, 60 cm−1 for\nboth the ν(C4O) modes at 1703 and 1691 cm−1, and a blue\nshift of about 200 cm−1 for the γ(N3H) vibration of monomer\n1.\nIt is worth noting that the magnitude of the vibrational shifts\nfor the modes of functional groups involved in the hydrogen\nbonds in the dimers can be considered as an indication of the\nstrength of the intermolecular interactions taking place in the\ncomplexes, which in turn reﬂects their relative stability. This is\nin agreement with the trend of the binding energies of the\ncomplexes under study that are reported in the Supporting\nInformation.\nAll harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies in the\nregion of hydrogen-bonding interactions (NH and CO\nstretchings and NH bendings) computed with the B3D3\nmodel are also listed in Table 4, along with more accurate\nresults obtained by computing the hybrid anharmonic\nfrequencies at the B2:B3 level of theory, with only a slight\nincrease of the computational burden. The mean absolute\ndeviation of the anharmonic B3D3 frequencies for all the\ndimers with respect to the hybrid anharmonic frequencies\ncomputed at the B2:B3 level of theory is of about 28 cm−1 in\nthe speciﬁc zone of the hydrogen-bonded functional groups,\nmainly due to the variation of NH stretching and bending\nvibrations, by 49 and 22 cm−1, on average, respectively. At\nvariance, for ν(NH), ν(CO), and γ(NH) modes not involved in\nhydrogen bonding the B3D3 and B2:B3 frequencies agree\nwithin 5 cm−1. Thus, the ONIOM B2:B3 scheme can be\nsuggested as an inexpensive method to correct the harmonic\npart of the vibrational frequencies of functional groups involved\nin strong hydrogen bonds, using the B3LYP-D3/N07D method\nfor computing the anharmonic corrections to these modes\ntogether with all other vibrational frequencies and IR\nintensities.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nThe possibility of accurately predicting the eﬀect of hydrogen-\nbonding interactions on the infrared spectral features is of\nfundamental importance to interpret experimental data of most\nsystems of interest in biology, drug design, biotechnology,\nnanosciences, material sciences, and so forth. Usually, hydro-\ngen-bonding interactions cause wide changes in the infrared\nspectrum, like shifts of the order of magnitude of hundreds of\ncm−1 and signiﬁcant increases in the intensity of IR bands of\nvibrational modes of functional groups directly involved in the\nhydrogen-bonded bridges. An accurate theoretical description\nof the relative infrared spectroscopic features is highly required\nto correctly interpret experimental outcomes. The problems of\nsimulating strongly anharmonic vibrations within hydrogen-\nbonded bridges are related to both possible limitations of the\nVPT2 treatment and the requirement of a very accurate\ndescription of the underlying PES.\nThis work shows that the GVPT2 model, combined with a\nsemidiagonal fourth-order polynomial representation of the\nanharmonic force ﬁeld in terms of normal modes, evaluated by\nmeans of density functional theory using the B3LYP-D3\nfunctional in conjunction with the N07D basis set, is reliable\nenough to describe the vibrational properties of hydrogen-\nbonded systems like uracil−water complexes, with average\nuncertainties within 22 cm−1 in the spectral region of hydrogen-\nbonding interactions. An improved description of the harmonic\npart of the vibrational frequencies of functional groups involved\nin the hydrogen-bonding interactions has been achieved by\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry A\nArticle\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.5b01561\nJ. Phys. Chem. A 2015, 119, 4224−4236\n4232\n",
    "application of the ONIOM B2PLYP:B3LYP scheme, which is a\nfocused model where only the part of the molecular system\nforming the hydrogen bonds is treated at the B2PLYP level of\ntheory. It leads to a deﬁnition of inexpensive hybrid approach,\nwith anharmonic corrections computed at B3LYP-D3 level,\nallowing us to obtain average uncertainties of about 10 cm−1 in\nthe spectral region of hydrogen-bonding interactions. There-\nfore, we have conﬁdently applied these methods to simulate the\nfully anharmonic infrared spectrum of six diﬀerent hydrogen-\nbonded uracil dimers to analyze the diﬀerences of their spectra\nand the changes in the infrared features due to the formation of\nthe hydrogen-bonding interactions. These theoretical predic-\ntions and proposed methodology can be useful for supporting\nfuture experimental investigations on hydrogen-bonded sys-\ntems like the uracil dimers.\n■ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*\nS\nSupporting Information\n(i) Cartesian coordinates of the equilibrium structures of all\ncomplexes optimized at the B3LYP-D3/N07D level.
