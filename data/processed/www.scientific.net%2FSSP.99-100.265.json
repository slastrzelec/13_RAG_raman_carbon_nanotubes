Preliminary results of Raman scattering measurements of multiwall carbon nanotubes \n(MWCNT) are presented. The nanotubes have been carefully dissolved, separated and then \ncharacterized by AFM. The micro-Raman spectra are taken with 514,5nm wavelength excitations in \nthe range 4K - 400K. Basically the spectra are quite similar to the well known single wall carbon \nnanotube spectra, but the low frequency band is absent. The major Raman bands, observed in single \nwall nanotubes are found in the spectra. In particular the disorder effects are visible due to the \npronounced D band at ~1350 cm-1. Metallic and semiconducting type of conductivity is \ndistinguished through analysis of the G (LO) mode at ~1600 cm-1. A new feature in these spectra \nexists at ~843 cm-1. Low energy radial breathing mode absence has been explained. \nIntroduction \nThe rapid development of carbon nanotubes research shows that atomic force microscopy (AFM) is \nan excellent tool for single nanotube characterization and treatment and that Raman spectroscopy is \na sensitive method of carbon nanotube characterization. Due to the specific combination of strong \nvan Hove singularities of the phonon density of states and Raman resonance effects it is possible to \nmeasure Raman scattering spectra of a small bundle of carbon nanotubes or even of a single \nnanotube. Recent progress in understanding the Raman spectra of relatively simple single wall \ncarbon nanotubes [1] stimulated further Raman studies of more complicated multiwall carbon \nnanotubes. The combination of Raman spectroscopy and AFM for characterization of MWNT gives \na new wider approach to the structure and quality of characterization.. \nSample Preparation and Experimental Procedure \nThe nanotubes were grown by the catalytic (Ni:Ce) method and were purified. The functionalization \nof the MWNT was performed as follows. First, a small amount of nanotubes in powder form were \nimmersed in appropriate solvent. A few different solvents were tested, but dichloromethane gave \nthe best results. For preliminary separation of the nanotubes a solution of MWNT was used and \nexposed to ultrasonic agitation for a few hours. The spin-coating method to place completely \nseparated nanotubes on an appropriate surface was also used. Three surfaces were tested: HOPG \n(Highly Oriented Pyrolitic Graphite), Si and SiO2, and finally SiO2 was chosen. It was noticed that \ninteraction between SiO2 and MWNT is very significant, probably due to strong van der Waal’s \nforces. The adhesion of nanotubes is astonishingly strong which is an important factor in the \nprocedure of nanotube separation. The spin-coating method is quite simple. We put the drop of the \nsolution with nanotubes onto fast rotating SiO2 surface (2500rpm), what cause that nanotubes are \nuniform spread on the surface. This procedure gives an additional contribution to the separation of \nnanotubes. The nanotubes were characterized with AFM (Fig. 1) in tapping mode (Nanoscope IIIa, \nDigital Instruments) and thr Raman spectra was recorded using DILOR 800 XY spectrometer. The \nRaman experiments were performed in ambient conditions and in helium for low temperature \nSolid State Phenomena Vols 99-100 (2004) pp 265-268\nOnline: 2004-07-31\n© (2004) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland\ndoi:10.4028/www.scientific.net/SSP.99-100.265\nAll rights reserved.

For sample scanning \nsilicon tips were used.  \n     \n \nFig. 1 Left part: AFM scan image (phase mode) of separated multiwall carbon nanotubes on SiO2 \nsurface; right part: 3D view (topography mode) on one of these nanotubes. Nanotubes are from \ncatalytic (Ni:Ce) method. There is Si (001) layer under the SiO2 250 nm layer. \nResults and discussion \nInterpretation of Raman spectra of SWNT has been provided by Rao et al. [2] and Dersselhaus et al. \n[3]. Recently multiwalled nanotubes have been studied extensively by Raman scattering [5, 6, 7]. \nand compared with SWNT.  All the Raman spectra shown in this paper were taken on samples \ncontaining randomly oriented MWCNT with two different concentrations of nanotubes on the SiO2 \nsurface. One sample had a nanotube concentration of approximately a few hundreds per 1µm circle \n(diameter of the laser spot) and second, with a few thousands nanotubes per 1µm spot. The Raman \nspectra are presented at Fig. 2. The difference between the samples can be seen by considering the \npeaks from Si (303cm-1, 521 cm-1, 963 cm-1). It was noticed that carbon nanotubes are good light \nabsorbers, so the sample of high MWCNT concentration (Fig. 2a) has Si modes of lower intensity. \n \nRaman studies of multiwalled nanotubes with large diameter distribution showed quite strong \nsimilarities to the SWNT modes [4]. The Raman spectra show three dominating features. In  Fig. 2: \ntwo sharp Raman peaks, namely G(graphite)-, D(disorder)-band are seen. Their second-order \nharmonic (the G’ band), explicitly appears at ~1580 cm-1, ~1360 cm-1 and ~2700 cm-1, respectively. \nIn addition, a small feature called G2 or D’ near 1610 cm-1 and other distinguishable features like \nG+D band (~2930 cm-1) and a small peak at ~ 843 cm-1, were observed. One important feature, a \nlow energy radial breathing mode at 248/dt cm-1, where dt is tube diameter usually observed in \nSWNT Raman spectra is absent.  The position and intensity of Raman peaks are in good agreement \nwith theoretical calculations for single walled nanotubes, showing that the vibration structure of \nMWCNT is similar to single walled nanotubes [4]. \n \nThe tangential G-band (at ~1580 cm-1), which derived from the graphite-like in-plane mode, (Fig. 2) \nis here split into two distinct peaks: G1 (1577 cm-1) and G2 (1610 cm-1). This was also reported in \nother papers [2,8]. These bands are related to the lattice vibration of all carbon materials with sp2 \nbonds. The shape of the G Raman peak gives the possibility of distinguishing between \nsemiconducting or metallic nanotubes. It is believed that these nanotubes are associated with \nsemiconducting type of conductivity. In the purified sample the G band is narrower than with the \nunpurified, which shows that these samples were well purified.  \n266\nFunctional Nanomaterials for Optoelectronics and other Applications\n",
    " \n \nFig. 2 Raman spectra of a bundle of muliwalled carbon nanotubes with high concentration (a) and \nlow concentration (b). \n \nThe disorder-induced D-band and its second-order harmonic, the G’-band were observed in all \nspectra. These two features both appear in the Raman spectra of semiconducting and metallic \ncarbon nanotubes. In the purified sample, the D-band is  weaker [5], but it can be also connected \nwith intrinsic impurities (defects) of nanotubes. It means that these carbon nanotubes are not the \nsame quality, because in all spectra the same intensity for the D-band was observed. Intensity \nvariation of the G’-band was also seen. AFM was used (Fig. 1) to check if the nanotubes were of \ngood quality, i.e. what is the arrangement of nanotubes on the surface; if the nanotubes were bent or \nstraight. The arrangement of nantobes can cause some structural changes e.g. strain deformation, \nand these changes can be detected with Raman spectroscopy. In addition AFM can detect for \nimpurities on the sample, i.e. small amount of soot,  amorphous carbon and catalyst residue.  \n \nThere is the interesting small feature at 843 cm-1, which is associated with armchair (n=8 to 11) \nsingle walled nanotubes [2]. All armchair nanotubes with this chirality are assigned as the \nsemiconducting type of nanotubes. That confirms the conclusion drawn from the G-band. This \nfeature was not observed in other studies of Raman spectroscopy of multiwall nanotubes. \nRadial breathing mode peaks were not found in any of the spectra. The explanation of this \nbehaviour can be made in two ways. First, when the nanotubes consists of too many walls (>20) and \nsecondly the inner wall diameter is too big (>2nm) [5], consequently the low energy peaks are too \nweak to be observed. From AFM studies the estimated outer diameter of nanotubes was between \n18nm and 40nm. Unfortunately from AFM nothing can be said about the internal diameter. Only \nfrom Raman spectra can it be estimated that internal diameters exceed 2 nm. \n \nTo reduce noise low temperature Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3) was perfprmed but radial breathing \nmode was still not visible. Besides there were no significant changes in the spectra in the \ntemperature range 4K - 400K. Only some insignificant shift of the major Raman peaks can be \nobserved as well as an anharmonic broadening of the peaks.         \n \nSolid State Phenomena Vols. 99-100\n267\n",

The Raman experiments were performed on \nbunches of nanotubes and are in good agreement with results given in existing literature. There is \nalso a new feature in Raman spectra at 843 cm-1, which was not observed in other Raman spectra \nstudies but it was theoretically calculated. A method of functonalization of nanotubes was \ndeveloped which probably allows work on a single nanotube. By optimizing functionalization \nparameters it is believed that it is possible to obtain such good separation of nanotubes that work \ncould be done on a single nanotube.  \nReferences \n[1] Raman spectroscopy on isolated single wall carbon nanotubes M.
